horrible experience while transiting,1,D Kalinova,Czech Republic,20th February 2022,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Absolutely horrible experience while transiting. Arrived on time (actually a little earlier), bridge to the plane was broken and the airline staff took over an hour to find us stairs/get us out of the plane. The nearest restroom after exiting the plane was 10 minutes walk. Had to take a bus to another terminal and on arrival, I had to go through security. The lady at the security check was absolutely horrible and made me take out all liquids from my carry on from plastic transparent Ikea bags to move the containers with liquids to transparent bags available at the airport. She said that she will throw my liquids away if I don't do that. "
Poor Taxi pickup organisation,2,Stephen Bennett,United Kingdom,20th February 2022,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Poor Taxi pickup organisation at Terminal 3 Heathrow’s new approach to divert taxis to level 3 of the car park to pick up arriving passengers is causing long queues, congestion and frustration for arriving passengers. All passengers are required to navigate 2 different elevators with children and luggage. I waited with my family with at least 150 other people waiting for lifts to get to our arriving taxi. When getting to the pick up point there was further delays due to the congestion of around 20 taxis trying to find their passengers. More can be done to ensure a more efficient operation at the easily accessible forecourt."
not in the same league as Gatwick,4,D Kelley,United Kingdom,7th February 2022,Not Verified ,"  Heathrow T3 is not in the same league as Gatwick. Lots of seating but dirty with food crumbs or footprints. The shopping is ok but limited as are food offerings. The Curator Restaurant was the one redeeming feature. Lovely breakfast, fast service, friendly staff and reasonable prices, can recommend. British Airways in future at Gatwick until Virgin have a change of heart. "
I received a penalty charge this week,1,Adriana Oikonomou,United Kingdom,16th January 2022,Not Verified ,"  I very rarely post reviews, however, I was looking for reviews about T5, to verify if others had problems with the 'Drop Off Zone' at T5 like I did. I had the same problem as reviewed below by Adrian Sharpe, I was looking for the multi-storey car park, and by mistake I entered in the Drop Off Zone. I did not stay, I immediately left the Drop Off Zone, and I found my way to the multi-storey car park. I parked and paid for my parking. To my absolute dismay I received a penalty charge this week, charging me £40 to have entered the Drop Off Zone. I am appealing this."
had to pay a extra charge of £40,1,Adrian Sharpe,United Kingdom,14th January 2022,✅ Trip Verified ," The car parking company, Apcoa, is, in my opinion, operating a corrupt practice. I wanted to pick my wife and children up (having parked nearby). The signs are utterly inadequate and don't tell you what you are doing. I asked a policeman in the end because there were no staff. You are funnelled towards the drop off zone. The short stay car park is signposted off to the right but almost unnoticeable. When you go in the drop off zone you are on APNR cameras and liable to pay. There is nothing obvious indicating this (I physically got out and looked). 19 days later I got a PCN. I pointed out that I was in a drop off zone, was supposed to be elsewhere (the policeman told me this) and had then gone to the short stay car park as directed. They weren't interested and fined me. An hour and a half held hostage by parking, paid £5.30 and then had to pay a extra charge of £40. Add to that that entry to the UK was standing in a congested line for an hour with all and sundry. "
Nobody seems to care about customer service,3,Brittainy Hilsman,United States,9th January 2022,Not Verified ,"  The worst experience! Upon touchdown we had to wait on the tarmac for about 10 minutes while the plane parked ahead of us tried to figure out what he was supposed to be doing. While transit through the airport and customs was a breeze (this was a first, usually takes over an hour), we waited for over half an hour for our luggage to start coming through on the belt. Meanwhile, we witnessed 20+ airport workers just hanging around joking and laughing like there weren’t hundreds of people across 4 flights waiting for their luggage to come through one conveyor. Nobody seems to care about customer service and everyone employee we encountered was rude and couldn’t be bothered to answer simple questions. By far the worst airport experience in my 30+ years of traveling. This airport should be ashamed!"
packed into the coach like sardines,2,R Pelton,United Kingdom,6th January 2022,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Notices everywhere about safe social distancing and hygiene, but the transfer bus from T5 to T3 was absolutely outrageous, packed into the coach like sardines. "
"a pleasant, mostly easy experience",8,W Carter,United States,27th December 2021,✅ Trip Verified ," While not entirely painless, I had a pleasant and mostly easy experience. I arrived in the UK from the US, traveling internationally for the first time and was given helpful information from both staff and repeat travelers at Heathrow. Customs was very quick and straightforward, taking less than 20 minutes. I arrived and was picked up from the airport all in under 1 hour which is rather impressive for traveling internationally. Great WiFi connection, ample restrooms and seating and before customs all signage was easy to follow. Signage post customs and by the car park/pick up area was quite hard to follow, but I will possibly lend some of that to being American. I was frustrated by the amount of conveyers out of service, especially for disabled or elderly travelers. Lifts were also a bit tricky to find, especially for the demographics who need them most. Other than that, accessibility is great with many wheelchairs, trollies and services for travelers in need. Just be sure to take your time with navigating the pick up area."
No social distancing,1,N Garzen,United Kingdom,2nd December 2021,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Arrived with BA0104 flight from Dubai. Going to the emigration area there was 2 employees who diverted me with my passport and Biometric Work Permit to the general (Rest of the World queue) There were around 300 people standing there, No social distancing, no attention from airports employees. Only 4-5 emigration officers were checking documents, air climatization is bad, people are getting tired, leaving the line for the WC visits and we are still not moving, 1 hour, 2 hours… you start looking at the other part where it’s dedicated to EU citizens. Why don’t you divert part of passengers there? Finally after 2½ hours they started to take families and give them priorities. It took me 3h15 min and I completed passport check in 30 seconds, officer never asked any questions just checked my Ukrainian passport and let me though. This is a pure disgrace."
will use Gatwick from now on,2,Stephen Crompton,United Kingdom,15th November 2021,Not Verified ,"  Terminal 5: Departure no problem, but dreadful queues on the way back - the Heathrow staff blamed multiple flights arriving at once, but with the skies less than full, this was a poor excuse. Well over an hour to get through the terminal, even though the e-gates were working - will use Gatwick from now on."
More revenue is all we care about!,1,Harry Last,United Kingdom,7th November 2021,Not Verified ,"  Hey Brains, I have an idea: why don't we charge people £5 to pick up passengers? We'll earn revenue from people who who aren't even travelling! Great idea, but won't that mean more people use the Short Stay car park instead and snarl up the lifts, cause extra queues and create even more chaos at Terminal 5, especially when some of our lifts don't even work? Yes, but who cares about them? More revenue is all we care about!"
security staff was rude to me,5,Jonathan Elizabeth,United Kingdom,9th October 2021,Not Verified ,"  When I got to the airport I had to go to T5 to get my test done, but due to a fight change I had to check in at T3. I had many bags, and one of the attendants was very helpful during the train transfer by getting a trolley for me once I got off the train. The check-in procedure was very quick and smooth. The attendant was extremely helpful and polite, and explained everything thoroughly and made sure I had everything I needed to have for my arrival at my destination. Afterwards I went back to T5 to get a document signed. I had asked about it before and was told it could be signed if I came back after receiving my test result. I was a bit annoyed when I returned and they refused to sign the document. When I was going through security the staff was rude to me. I had started preparing my stuff in the line and was ready to finish unpacking my stuff once I could put my bag down. He kept repeating his instructions and did not give me a chance to finish before he repeated it again. I got very frustrated with him, which resulted in him being extremely patronizing. "
Chaos reigns at arrivals,1,Richard Clarke,United Kingdom,28th July 2021,✅ Trip Verified , Chaos reigns at arrivals & long queues & e gates that don’t work so many passengers including this reviewer was refused after several attempts..what dreadful machines these are...so you had to queue like all the other arriving passengers..it’s dreadful uncoordinated & not enough border force people to man the counters. Air Conditioning is a joke in this hall as every passenger was sweating.....it’s truly dreadful organization with machines that don’t work! Staff here are rude abrupt & really don’t care about the jobs they are employed to do!
it is a good airport,8,Marco Lufez,United Kingdom,30th June 2021,Not Verified ,"  When I went to this airport, it was quite busy. I was traveling with my 6 children and my wife, we were going to LA. The staff were super helpful and kind, the shops were okay, some of them were closed. Wifi service was okay, I had to make some phone calls but other than that it is a good airport, recommended."
disorganised facility with very poor signage,1,G Waters,United Kingdom,1st March 2021,Not Verified ,"  Where do I start? Having travelled back via GRU and CDG, LHR is a third world experience. I was shocked. Untrained staff who check no paperwork (locator and PCR), disorganised facility with very poor signage, everything seemed to be on a cost basis. Chaos. . Then we come to the long stay carparking. I had to alter the booking 2 times. No problem in extending and paying more money, easy to do online. When it comes to shortening forget it. The system won't allow. I asked for a refund by email, to be given a reply ""claim on your travel insurance"". "
no enforcement of any of the covid guidelines set in the UK,3,T Richards,United States,19th February 2021,✅ Trip Verified ," Even though we are in the middle of a pandemic, I did not see any real changes to when I last visited Heathrow Airport last year in January. There was no enforcement of any of the covid guidelines set in the UK, or when there were some attempts at social distances they made no sense and were extremely redundant. When exiting the plane after waiting for the majority of the passengers to leave, I was approached by a very rude and hostile security guard. As I was travelling alone he made sure to speak with me rather than the family with two children (with no masks) walking behind me. I have taken the covid precautions seriously therefore I was wearing PPE (white disposable overalls, n95 mask, and face shield). The guard, sarcastically mocked if I were travelling to paint and then began berating me about how it is my fault that there is still a pandemic going on. Considering that there are far more people who flaunt their ignorance of the guidelines it is baffling why he was being like this about it whereas the family behind me was let off. Ridiculous. The border control guard, however, was the complete opposite. He asked about my reason of visit which I promptly gave as well as telling him all the precautions I have taken and he was very polite and understanding and let me through with not an ounce of attitude."
shocking procedures,1,Scott Girvan,United Kingdom,1st February 2021,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Where do I start? We are in a so called pandemic as the government says. Well what I experienced today I would of never of thought that I could float from terminal 2 arrivals to departure with not one person challenging me to ask why am I here or where am I going? As I was seeing my wife and daughter away to Thailand by government rules I was allowed to do. I proceeded to terminal 5 for my flight back to Aberdeen. Well I was in for more of a shock. Main entrance only had a bit cardboard saying if not a traveller do not proceed anymore than this point, where was security to stop anyone from walking in off the street with any disease with no checks, shocking procedures."
so shocked at how backwards Heathrow feels,3,Alex Reynolds,United Kingdom,29th December 2020,Not Verified ,"  I am so shocked at how backwards Heathrow feels. I fly for work regularly and I'm not very critical. The lack of personal support and consideration for customer experience is pretty shocking. Feels like Brexit is already taking its toll! I will fly through Schiphol, Frankfurt (or anywhere!) from now on. Disappointed and a bit ashamed to be British!"
"Terrible, disgraceful immigration experience",1,Bassam El Khouri,Qatar,17th December 2020,Not Verified ,"  Terrible, disgraceful immigration experience, 200 people cramped in queues with 1 immigration counter open. Then you complain about rising Covid cases, people are catching it at your airport. Shameful especially during this pandemic when people have been away from loved ones. This shows lack of respect and incompetent management leaving 1 immigration officer on her own. Disgraceful."
Awful experience today,3,Daniela Tulea,United Kingdom,16th November 2020,Not Verified ,"  Awful experience today at the security’s before departure. I was asked in a very rude manner to remove my boots and then, with a horrible body language and voice, I was told there were no disposable shoe cover available? I wonder if the authority can’t afford to hire decent, polite staff or if they need to save money from the cleaning company and asking the customers to wipe the floors instead?"
it was a very straightforward process,8,Imtiaz Quwailid,United Kingdom,18th October 2020,✅ Trip Verified ," First overseas trip of 2020 and surprisingly it was a very straightforward process through Heathrow Terminal 2. We arrived with 3 hours before departure but needn’t have worried. Travelling to Warsaw on LO282, our check in was completed online 24 hrs before. The check in area was quiet and we walked straight up to the kiosk to print our luggage tags. After issuing the tags, the kiosk printed paper boarding passes without any prompt - trying to save paper, we had already got our passes on our mobile phones. Would advise airlines to check if passengers need a paper pass at the kiosk. Once our luggage was tagged, we walked straight over to a drop off desk. In the past, there would be a queue, but given our early arrival at the airport, and the drop in passenger numbers this year, queueing wasn’t required. Tags scanned and luggage on its way, we joined the queue through security. Only two lanes were open, but the staff were extremely quick in moving passengers through. Before we knew it we were airside. From walking into the terminal to getting through security only took 20 mins. Obviously the main difference this year is the number of travellers going through Heathrow (or any airport for that matter). Airside was much quieter than we have seen, and one can only imagine the loss in revenue for the high end shops that cater to the wealthy passengers. We made do with visiting World Duty Free, then WHSmiths (always need some reading material) followed by a pint at the pub on the upper level. Naturally everyone is wearing masks and observing social distancing. My wife was disappointed that the perfume samples were not available - for me this was a major plus as I would usually have to wait ages for her to try different scents before choosing which to buy. Our flight usually departed from a B gate, but given the low number of flights, we were directed to one of the gates at the main lounge. Arriving back to Terminal 2 a week later was a little bit busier than before. To start off with as we deplaned, we had to show our COVID documentation (completed online 2 days before). Several fellow passengers had not done this so had to stand to one side and do it there and then. Our arrival coincided with a couple of long hauls from the Far East so there was a long queue at passport control. This wasn’t helped by only three e-gates being used. Just as I got to the front of the queue, they closed the e-gate! However, a member of staff was very good at getting three lanes down through the 2 remaining e-gates. I wonder how these queues will change once we end the transition period at the end of the year. By the time we got through passport control and walked over to the carousel, the luggage was just being brought out. From exiting the aircraft to leaving the terminal took 50 mins."
one of the worlds most awful airports,1,P Orsman,United Kingdom,5th October 2020,Not Verified ,"  Well I was pleased to see that in 2018 Terminal 2 was awarded ‘Terminal of the Year.’ Because after waiting in a 6 hour immigration line today I was grateful I was not at the worlds worst terminal, because that would have been simply awful. Heathrow must truly be one of the worlds most awful airports."
Staff are not friendly,3,Tia Ebrahim,United Kingdom,7th September 2020,Not Verified ,"  I generally enjoy the service at Heathrow. However, the customer service at duty free bare minerals is appalling. Staff are not friendly, there is a lack of foundation shade variety and diversity and staff made absolutely no attempt to offer any help or sincere advice. Would not attend again."
directions very visible and helpful,9,E Edwards,United Kingdom,14th June 2020,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Excellent airport to travel from, we organised,  professional well trained and helpful staff, A wide range of duty free shops, Signage and directions very visible and helpful, seating area is great, Business lounge is fantastic, even though at times there are long queues due to the efficiency and intuition of the dedicated staff these queues move quite quickly. I have always travelled through this airport despite living over three hours away, the standards at this airport improves each time I have travelled through it inevitably adding a positive experience to my travels In all honesty I cannot pick a single fault or negative experience that I have been through at this airport."
I was expecting more choice of food,6,B Davies,United Kingdom,22nd April 2020,✅ Trip Verified ," The airport is spacious, looks pretty, however for this kind of airport I was expecting more choice of food in terminal 2. Compared with Gatwick, Gatwick is much better. Staff should have better training at check in area. Not family friendly. Its good if you travel alone outside Europe."
will avoid as much as possible,1,Ovidiu Ionut,Romania,18th March 2020,✅ Trip Verified ," Poor airport and security measures. Was in transit coming from New York going to Bucharest. Of course we had to pass security again, even though it was transit and the same terminal. So anything you might have bought back in New York was good to throw out. Luckily for us it was just some bottles of water. But at security, I had a can of Powder spray for the shoes/feet. The can was clearly Powder, measured in grams and was on an outside net pocket of my backpack. The security staff, instead of just taking care of the can, they got everything out of my backpack, every single individual thing, including cosmetics that were actually in the bag on the tray, and put them directly on the incredibly filthy tray (exactly what I tried to avoid touching with my stuff). This was done at a very slow pace. Also my dad had issues with all his bags, instead of going directly to the problem, the staff touched and got everything out of the bag. Hopefully I never have to use this airport ever again, will avoid as much as possible."
received nothing but helpful and cheerful service,10,R&M Henricksen,Canada,18th March 2020,Not Verified ,  Had to return home early due to Coronavirus. The airport was extremely busy. We received nothing but helpful and cheerful service from all staff. Thank you guys for a job more than well done.
idiotic systems and procedures,2,I Mack,United Kingdom,9th March 2020,Not Verified ,"  Someone needs to explain to me why I go through security at Edinburgh and then have to go through it again when arriving in London when all I have done is go on a plane in the UK and got off a plane in the UK? I’m in Transit you morons - I have not left the Airport / I am arriving at the same Terminal that I am leaving from to go on my International Flight (Terminal 5) but I have already done Security at Edinburgh! Different story if I have left the Airport, spent a few hours in London and then returned - that I get! Sounds too much like common sense to Heathrow? - they deal with idiotic systems and procedures that bear no resemblance to reality / order. This nonsense is compounded by moronic staff who get their kicks out of being exceptionally stupid / rude and arrogant."
VAT refund was horrible,2,Y Chan,Hong Kong,5th March 2020,✅ Trip Verified ,"  The check in has to be done by machines which for me kept failing and ended up needing staff to help us. Also, the VAT refund was horrible. Only 2 staffs were there and although many people were waiting, the staffs were slow. There were about 20 people in front of us when we first arrived at the queue, and after 1 and a half hour, only 10 has been processed! "
my experience was always positive,10,D Egginton,Indonesia,28th January 2020,✅ Trip Verified ," Over the last 5 months I have visited Terminals 2, 4 and 5. Credit where it is due, whether it was departing or arriving my experience was always positive."
Well done Terminal 3!,10,Gavin Livingstone,United Kingdom,25th January 2020,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Well done Terminal 3! Departed from there yesterday on AA flight to Miami with my wife. Unfortunately she had just twisted her knee and was struggling to walk far, but all the staff were very polite and helpful. Security was polite and professional, then a member of staff offered to get my wife a wheelchair (without prompting), which she declined as she thought she could manage. But the gate was a long way, and she wasn’t managing very well, then one of the electric buggy drivers saw us and stopped, turned round and took us to our gate. Again at the gate all staff were polite and helpful. Just to let everyone there know that we appreciated your great attitude!"
I got randomly selected,2,Jam Muri,United Kingdom,24th January 2020,Not Verified ,"  I got randomly selected by a staff prior to entering ""nothing to declare"" gate. Immediately asked if are you from Dubai instead of checking my boarding pass/ticket. Then asked if I had any tobacco, I said no, I wouldn't buy those because I have asthma, to which he chuckled and said ""I didn't ask if you have asthma, I asked if you have tobacco"". I firmly said no."
Hugely impressed by Heathrow T3,9,P Roberts,United Kingdom,15th January 2020,✅ Trip Verified ," Hugely impressed by Heathrow T3. Having said that, my local airport is MAN which is like a 3rd world, despot run nightmare. Flew with AA. Boarding a full flight was calm quick and orderly. Prior to that, security was a breeze, with polite, non-shouty staff (MAN take note). A very nice breakfast followed and it made a great start to a weekend away. On return, immigration was quick and I was in the carpark bus within minutes."
no smoking areas here,3,D Rijkers,Netherlands,15th January 2020,Not Verified , I never came on an airport where it not possible to smoke. Why are there no smoking areas here?
go out of their way to make life difficult,3,Robert Davis,United Kingdom,6th December 2019,Not Verified ,  The south security gate was closed and all passengers were directed to the north portion and the queues were simply horrendous. Heathrow security thrives on beings rude and unpleasant and go out of their way to make life difficult. The amenities in the airport are geared up for millionaires and full of designers outlets unfortunately not much fun for the normal people. Flights are never on time so don’t expect a happy visit. I avoid this airport whenever possible.
experience absolutely awful,2,Harriet Mak,United Kingdom,3rd December 2019,Not Verified ," Had just come off a 12-hour flight from Hong Kong and had to connect to get a domestic flight. We arrived at Terminal 5 but we were at the C Gates, so we were required to travel to the main terminal by train. It was around 5 in the morning and at least 2 flights had landed with a large number of passengers. There was only one train available that needed to take people back to the main terminals before returning to the C Gates and back and forth, so this took longer than expected. We were then required to go through security again however there were no signs or guides advising that we needed to do this. In some other international airports that we have connected, there is no need to go through security checks again. Because we only had 2 hours to connect, we decided we would try and head straight over to our gate before going to the toilets etc., but we encountered security instead. The queues were all over the place and you could see everyone was a bit fed up at this point. I had just come off the plane with at least 500ml of water left as well and instead of being helpful, I was shouted at for having a large bottle of water and was told to empty it on the spot by drinking it all (seriously?) or the security guard would bin my water bottle (was desperate for the toilet as well at this point). When we told her that nobody informed us that there would be security checks again, she shrugged and told us we should've emptied it in the toilets - obviously, I would've done that if I knew we had to go through this again! Overall she was incredibly rude, treated us as if we were stupid, put the blame on us and made our experience absolutely awful. If I had gotten her name I would've made a formal complaint. Honestly the worst airport I have ever experienced and would avoid in the future if possible."
should do smoking areas,2,Daniel Borges,United Kingdom,27th November 2019,Not Verified ," It is ridiculous, I understand that is the law not to smoke inside the airport but they should do smoking areas for the people who are travelling more them 12h in the row (I just arrived from a connection flight)."
Horrible customer service,3,Anna Hrafska,United Kingdom,17th November 2019,✅ Trip Verified , 5 Check in machines I tried were out of service. Horrible customer service! Staff member at the check in desk was rude and ignorant. She asked me whether my final city destination was Turkey and then had a go at me for not knowing the airport code. Very very bad!
Very kind security control service,8,B Nowak ,Poland,13th November 2019,✅ Trip Verified , Arrival to Terminal 2. Departure from Terminal 4. Both Terminals are very ok. No big queues to security control. All information presented loud and clear. Very kind security control service.
airport is totally incompetent,3,Tugce Mutluer,Germany,11th November 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," This airport is totally incompetent. They took my jam off me but they left my razor in my carry on. Very poor, I don’t feel safe here and there is no security check that I can rely on."
Security staff hate their job,1,G Ralph,Finland,8th November 2019,Not Verified ," Security staff hate their job. We're a family of 4 with 2 small kids and connecting to Miami at Heathrow terminal 3. First we have to go through the security check in Helsinki and get rid of all our drinks, buy water, drinks and even a bottle of liquor at Helsinki. Arriving after a 2.5hr flight at Heathrow, with 90 minutes to change flights. First you need to go through exact the same security check as in Helsinki. Security staff yelling and threatening people to listen to them or else they will be delayed. Here you are as a parent trying to get your family to another plane for a nice and stress free vacation. Unfortunately I forgot to take 2 iPads out of my bag. A simple mistake. The security staff took my bag (and several other bags of “criminals”, including an old English lady who clearly had difficulties understanding the instructions) to put it aside for at least 15 minutes before eving looking at it. The bag and iPads now needed some special investigation and it took another 15 minutes before I had my bag back. While I was waiting I could see several other people in the same situation, staff not trying at all to help the travelers, staff yelling and cursing at people for not putting the trays at the correct place. We had to run from the security check to the gate, me carrying a crying 3 year old, and a 7 year old trying to keep up. What a relief to make it to the gate and meet the incredible nice and friendly staff of British Airways. I feel bad for them, but I will never fly again via Heathrow. We had plenty of alternatives to fly to Miami, but thought Heathrow was a world class airport. Oh and the glass bottle of liquor I bought at Helsinki airport tax free and had with me in the flight to Miami. Not a single word to get that through security."
terminal was clean and airy,8,J Tung,United Kingdom,23rd October 2019,Not Verified ,  Departed from LHR T2 to Bangkok in October (evening). The check in for premium passengers was hassle free and security check was super efficient. In fact I've never encountered long security checks in any of the Heathrow terminals. It's one of the most efficient security I've been through. Once passed security there were plenty of shops or sitting areas with charging facilities. The terminal was clean and airy. On arrival we were connected to jet bridge in no time and was out of the plane very quick. Early evening on a Sunday with multiple wide bodied planes landing resulted in longer immigration queue. However the queue kept moving fast and most of the e gates were in operation. From landing to clearing immigration it took me less than 25 minutes despite the busy landing time. The only disadvantage or slightly negative experience on T2 is the long walk between the main building A and the satellite gates B (where most long haul flights depart/arrive). You have to go down and up on long escalators.
rudeness of security staff,3,S Poon,United Kingdom,20th October 2019,Not Verified ,"  The rudeness of security staff is unbelievable. One tells you to load your contents one way, others want them laid out differently. You can hear one of them complaining the passengers were not listening to his instructions. Do they realise we are their customers? Without us, they won't have a job. "
security queues are quick and painless,8,H Simpson,United Kingdom,18th October 2019,✅ Trip Verified , Traveled in and out of Heathrow four times this year. Most recently on Terminal 5. It's a good airport. I don't understand the complaints about this. The security queues are quick and painless and the self service bio metric check on arrival with the machines work well and I'm out of the terminal into the underground within 10 minutes of landing. The toilets are well maintained and the prices of food and drinks with the variety means there is choice for all price points. The negative is lack of seating throughout the terminal as nearly all the space is taken up by retail shops.
immigration queues extremely long,1,W Lee,United Kingdom,17th October 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Worst airport for two reasons. Firstly, the security staff I encountered are very rude and unhelpful. When they try to check your bags, they do it at an incredibly slow pace that's literately maddening for anyone trying to catch a flight. Secondly the immigration queues are extremely long and counters are poorly staffed, normally people have to wait for an hour or so to go through immigration which is unbelievable. One time for a complete 15 minutes interval there was not a single staff member serving at the counters, not a single one! "
despise this airport,1,John Delatore,United States,10th October 2019,Not Verified ," I absolutely despise this airport, not because of their layout, though it's rather complicated and time-consuming to get around, but because of the staff running the security. For the second time now, the last time was about 5 years ago and I swore that would be the last time I went through Heathrow, but security seemed to find yet again a way to cause me to be within minutes of missing my next flight. Both times my items breezed through the scanner, but ""I"", who had no metal objects on or in me, had to be scanned twice, and held to a very aggressive body pat-down. They even used two hand held metal scanners to search me and couldn't find a thing. I'm wearing a cotton shit, jeans and socks, no shoes. It took them well over 15 minutes to perform this abuse of power, and for a reason, I have no idea of. These people are truly messed up, I despise them and hope never again to have to go to that horrible airport again."
have new found admiration for Heathrow,9,P James,United Kingdom,9th October 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," I have been on a series of wide ranging business trips and now have new found admiration for Heathrow having used it at least 20 times in the last 4 months. The main thing is it realises it is an airport with shopping not the other way round. Inbound the connections from Domestic to an International can be made in 20 minutes - I have to do it at least twice on Sunday evenings as my flight has been delayed. The signs are clear, the 5A to 5B or 5C shuttle is effcient and never seems crowded. I have access to BA First class or Concorde lounges but have tried other lounges and bars and they all seem good (one in T5 beside the domestic gate lounge is very good at serving rapidly). There are loads of snack type outlets but it doesn't stink of food everywhere. On arrival the e-passport gates and security works very efficiently and I am not sure fast track actually delivers very much. Shopping is very good and I can't fault the terminal cleanliness. Two issues stop it getting a 10/10 - firstly if you are on a remote stand it is a very long bus ride and the buses are not very good, and secondly the have too many slots so if you are on alate out say 21.00-13.00 then you are going to spend a lot of time at the gate or in a queue."
Totally unacceptable,1,Donald Maclean,United Kingdom,2nd October 2019,Not Verified ,  From landing to exiting the airport took 3 hours! This is meant to be a world class airport and this took almost as long as the flight itself. Totally unacceptable.
horrendous experience with the tax refund office,1,Serena Yee,Malaysia,1st October 2019,Not Verified ,"  I’m compelled to write this review after a horrendous experience with the tax refund office at T4. British wit and world famous repute for good education and common sense is no where evident as we queue in dingy surroundings, eye sight gradually deteriorating due to faulty blinking fluorescent lighting, somehow no money forthcoming from the coffers of the wealthy British Empire for a replacement tube. Rows and rows of happy holiday makers after enjoying gentle British hospitality, cursing the somewhat hostile system of tax refund, obviously aimed at discouraging visitors from claiming what is rightfully theirs, in a cunning, sneaky, unfriendly, money-faced manner. Having travelled extensively, contributing to the healthy economies of a large number of countries, I can safely say this tax refund system and premise to be the absolute worst, even surpassing Paris’s CDG many times over. Common sense dictates more counters required for expeditious service, better ventilation (!) in a bigger area, toilet facilities, seating areas for the elderly and those with children and properly functioning lights (basic requirement!). This system of screwing visitors is keeping the economy afloat in a most underhanded manner. How disappointing that we leave Bonny ol England with this impression and what a put-off!"
plenty of signage and helpers,10,C Lewis,United Kingdom,1st October 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Still the best airport I’ve been to, it’s quick and easy to get through check-in and security. Duty free is good, and a fast transfer is made easy by plenty of signage and helpers."
Very confusing and complicated,2,Brian Oswald ,United Kingdom,1st October 2019,Not Verified ,"  Baggage drop off for my mum, traveling to Singapore. Very confusing and complicated. We had already done online check-in the night before and still had to wait 25 minutes for baggage drop. Also very difficult to find the right queue."
impressive for a harshly criticized airport,8,Daniel Baiks,United Kingdom,29th September 2019,Not Verified ,"  This was the very first time in Heathrow, really impressive for a harshly criticized airport. First of all, very clean airport. Terminal 2 is always spick and span and presentable. Signs are very helpful, want to go to the tube? Arrivals, then underground. Don't know the terminal you're going to? Check their website and find your airline's terminal. Queuing times are efficient as they take into account the intense amount of passengers that go through the airport, just not the planes, you'll be waiting 10, maybe 20 minutes waiting to take off, possibly missing a connecting flight. Seating wise, the seats are quite good to rest on for a person who lives quite far from airports. The food is fatty but really tasty. I expected so much less from an airport like this. The staff are genuinely lovely. Especially some of the staff at the UK border that are pleasant to speak to. Overall, a very good airport to fly in if you're not on a time crunch."
there is no excuse for their hostility,1,Elizabeth Meuser,United States,19th September 2019,Not Verified ,"  
The screeners were vicious morons. If a sensor lights up, that means certain areas are to be inspected. Fine. But a lit sensor did not mean that I was guilty of something. The screener pummeled me and kept saying, ""Ma'am"" in an officious tone. I am a little-ish old lady with blue eyes and light brown hair, an American of Germanic descent. I have not been out of the United States since 2008, on a cruise in the Caribbean. I would be stunned if anyone could find a terrorist of my description but the screener acted as if I were carrying a grenade. I realize that your screeners may not be the brightest of people but there is no excuse for their hostility and complete lack of common sense. There is no other word than, ""Bully."" If the screeners keep up at this, someone is going to sue them for battery. We have relief in common. I would rather be buried alive than travel to England again and the screeners will never see me again. The trip was supposed to be a birthday celebration for me. Not much of a celebration."
plenty of helpful staff,10,John Davies,United Kingdom,8th September 2019,Not Verified ,"  Quick efficient passage, through Terminal 2, plenty of helpful staff available to assist, check in and Security queues were minimal. Security staff efficient and quite pleasant, terminal was fairly busy but clean and tidy and easy to navigate from entrance to departure gate."
a very good to excellent terminal,9,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,6th September 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Leaving - T5 is still one of my favourite terminals. there have been some changes since my last visit in 2017. Self Check in is now the norm. At 05.30 on a Friday morning, it wasn't that busy. Terminal signage indicated that South was less busy than North for getting through security, and indeed it was and it delivers you right outside the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, which is excellent! Flight left from C57, which must be one of the furthest gates from the main terminal. It is also a long walk to the plane from there. Arriving - E-Gates are now the norm for immigration. It was quite busy, and I fear that if there is a Hard Brexit, it will be very chaotic at the UK Border. Bags from my flight started to arrive on the belt as I arrived in the Baggage Hall. Overall still a very good to excellent terminal."
there was no trolley,1,Divya Patel,United Kingdom,30th August 2019,Not Verified ,  I traveled with my family from terminal 2 to USA. Came back on terminal 2. The biggest issue was claiming baggage there was no trolley at all to keep your bags.?when I asked them they said they run out of trolley. After an hour of claiming our bags I found 1 trolley and some how managed to came out. When we came out I can’t believe it but there was so many trolley outside - airport staff was just going around but not bother to bring the trolley inside the airport. Very disappointed. I think they not bother about service.
No hassle at all,9,T Jackson,United Kingdom,21st August 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Terminal 5 is a very good terminal. There is lots of space and the queue times are not very long. Security would be my only issue, as a lady was very unpleasant to passengers queuing up for security. Through security, there are a good range of shops and food options at a reasonable price (for an airport). There were plenty of departure screens and signage was good. No hassle at all when travelling through Heathrow Terminal 5."
Worst transit airport,1,A Morris,United States,18th August 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Worst transit airport in the world. You will miss your flight or be running to the terminal while having a panic attack at the 100 thoughts going through your head on how to reschedule a missing flight. This is due to the extra security for liquids. I left my chapstick in my purse along with a prescription eye drop size of my pinky which warranted extra security! This is insanely ridiculous! Extra security took forever. My colleague wasn’t able to put all her toiletries in the small clear plastic bag they provide. The bag has to fully close and hers didn’t, thus extra security warranted for her. After going through the extra security, she had to dump the things that didn’t fit in this ridiculous small bag. We ended missing our flight. No other airport makes you go through this scrutinizing process of extra security that only causes delays and angry passengers. I’ll never fly through Heathrow again."
T2 is a truly awful experience,2,F Lewis,United States,18th August 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," T2 is a truly awful experience. Firstly, try to get up and down in the lifts from the car park in less than 20 minutes. Total bottleneck, always full, and if you don’t dive in the doors shut on you in a nano-second. Then try to get VAT reclaim in less than an hour, with queues out of the door and rude service. Then try and walk to the furthest gates and see if you have survived the T2 experience. Throw fast-track security in that doesn’t allow our child to come through with us (Star Alliance Gold Elite) together with the worst shopping selection and now you have my nemesis airport."
VAT refunds with long queues,1,C Han,Singapore,15th August 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,"  This is one of the worst airport I have been to. Services are slow, staff were rude to me, VAT refunds are impossible with long queues. When I have a feedback regarding the VAT service, the staff said that I am the only one giving a negative feedback. Really? "
Terminal 2 is a good terminal,8,M Hardasan,United Kingdom,8th August 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,  Terminal 2 is a good terminal. Not too big and small. Just the right size for the volume of traffic. Security length was short and I was inside the terminal within 10 mins. Polite staff. Good range of shops and the gates and toilets are clearly signposted. Plenty of seating available. Coming back I was out of the airport within 10 mins as I used the new self service passport screening machines. I'm impressed.
unnecessary extra check,3,C Gomez,United States,8th August 2019,Not Verified ,"  Rude airport security workers. The airport is fine until you get to the gates, that’s where they do an unnecessary extra check of your luggage and carryon and ask you  questions to distract you and get you to give information. I did not like my experience and the unnecessary checks."
security check is a nightmare,1,William Stein,United States,29th July 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I always try to avoid a Heathrow as going through security check is a nightmare. They can have 5 bags pulled for further check yet 1 checker leaves on break. Appears they don't like their job or they get off on terrorizing travelers. They take everything out and dump it in a bin leaving you to carefully fit everything back in your carry on quickly. Numerous people said they are going to miss their flight but they just shrug.  I was given an orange express card yet they didn't look at my luggage first. I'm all for security but not in the manner these heartless people do it. Heathrow, worst airport in the world."
lifts are too small,3,Frank Rispin,United Kingdom,29th July 2019,Not Verified ,  Terminal 2 is ok in many ways. But the lifts between car park and arrivals and departure floors are too small. Lifts constantly arrive already full. 2. Cafes landside are far fewer ie 2 than old T3.  Walk to gates is a marathon including massive down escalator immediately followed by 2 up escalators. Fancy baggage carousels on arrival are slow owing to stupid traffic light system that slows the whole thing up.
Terminal 3 was exceptionally smooth,7,Anurag Dave,United States,27th July 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," The arrival experience in Heathrow's Terminal 3 was exceptionally smooth. During immigration, US citizens were allowed to use the kiosks for UK citizens, which made the process quicker. While flying back to US on a Sunday, the check-in and security lines in T3 were long. After security, the terminal was crowded, but there were open seats available. The seating area doesn't provide any plane spotting opportunity. Terminal 3 has a shopping mall vibe, so the shopping and dining options are fantastic. In Heathrow, the boarding gate is displayed minutes before boarding starts. When I was walking to my gate, I saw a sign that read, ""No restrooms beyond this point."" Overall, Terminal 3 is good, but Terminal 2 still provides the best experience in Heathrow."
Staff friendly and security was easy,9,Glenn Taylor-Biffen,United Kingdom,21st July 2019,Not Verified ,"  T5 is light and an unhindered with space. Staff friendly and security was easy. The only unhelpful hindrance to our staffing experience was the assistant at the bag drop, (then again, that is down to the Airline). The other issue is the Heathrow website on the screens at the tables in Ramsey's restaurant)/bar, the information greatly differs to that of the actual information screens: The former showed a delay, the latter showed the gate boarding as of now!"
What a total nightmare,3,L Giannotti,United States,19th July 2019,Not Verified ,"  Security was similar to the 9/11 experience if you are old enough to remember what that was like. Every little “cream or liquid like item” was thoroughly checked! Once we (as middle aged Americans) passed through that check point, my husband was singled out for an additional check. He had 3 agents on him at once. It took 10 minutes while they dumped again every last item out of his bag! I tried to take a photo of him only and was then harassed by a staffer and told to show my phone with pictures! What a total nightmare! We are simply visiting tourists!"
don't want to use the scan machines,1,G Herman,United States,19th July 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We arrived hours early and almost missed the flight because of the queues. Those who don't want to use the scan machines and opt for the pat down are lectured for ages on their disobedience while the bags are scanned and hand checked for hours. Also the walk from security to the gate was 20 mins.Luckily our flight was delayed. This will be the last time, Heathrow. It used to be a good airport."
the service was inefficient and sloppy,4,Gary Weinstein,United Kingdom,9th July 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," First time using the new Heathrow Terminal 2 to departure from / arrive to. Disappointed both times. At departure the check-in machines weren't accepting valid bookings. Long queues built up a check-in desks and check-in weren't proactive in opening more desks. One member even said ""I wondered why the queue was so long"" and yet that wasn't sufficient to prompt them to do something about it. On return around 22.45 the finger took a long time being deployed and then suitcases took ages to arrive. Big pause of around 15 minutes between first and second batch of bags coming through. For a modern terminal the service was inefficient and sloppy. Would avoid using this terminal again if possible."
found the experience excellent,9,M Butler,Cyprus,27th June 2019,Not Verified ,  Terminal 2 - found the experience excellent. Very helpful staff on the automated check in. No delay on getting rid of baggage. Short wait for security. Loads of seating in the lounge. The whole place was very clean. Absolutely nothing to dislike.
Staff were hopeless,1,D Dawson,United Kingdom,21st June 2019,✅ Trip Verified , Use Amsterdam or Copenhagen for a good experience not Heathrow! BA flight from Bangkok - 2 hours late - rushing for Edinburgh flight - no help from BA. Customs and Security were a joke - automated equipment did not work. Boarding Passes did not register. Staff were hopeless - I will never use Heathrow again!
a stress free start to our holiday,10,S Mardon,United Kingdom,20th June 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Heathrow airport is very near to where we live so use it for travelling. We use Terminal 5 to travel to Corfu. We checked in online the day before. Outbound we used the self service bag drop and was assisted by a lovely ground staff lady to deliver our cases. We went to Security which had a very small queue and passed through with ease, no pushing or being forced to move through quickly. Spent time at a restaurant for breakfast. After breakfast we waited for our gate number. The Terminal is very clean and tidy, any of the ground staff will help with any queries or questions with politeness. We always use Terminal 5 for convenience and a stress free start to our holiday."
Airport staff was nice,5,E Garman,United States,18th June 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I flew through LHR twice on this vacation. I had to connect from T2 to T5 from Air New Zealand to British Airways. Finding the connection was easy, but it was a bit unclear which bus I should take and it made random stops where people weren't told anything. Airport staff was nice, some were funny too. On my return flight I had the same connection issues. Signage in T2 could be more clear as I nearly exited the airport."
Queued for 45 minutes,4,B Watkin,United Kingdom,11th June 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Awful arrived at 04.45 to find 3 check in desks open for several flights. Queued for 45 minutes to do my bag drop. Asked the young assistant why it was taking so long and got told it was because a lot of passengers turned up at the same time. What a surprise when there are so many early flights. Also people who turn up with 4 times their baggage allowance and then start arguing over the cost of excess charge should be sent to a separate check in and wait.

"
worst security experience,1,S Marden,United States,6th June 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,"  The bag check in is now automated which means there is no one to help. Waiting in line to try to figure out the system by ourselves. Took a few tries. Stressful. Then the worst security experience of my life. I was pushed, hurried, shoved around, roughly searched. They took off my prescription glasses and I couldn’t see anything to find the buckets that held my phone, handbag etc. The search was brisk, invasive and there was no one polite enough to help me after they were finished with me. I have never felt shocked and distressed in a security check before and there was no one behind us, so there was absolutely no need to shove me through. "
Good riddance Heathrow,1,Patrick Kelly,United States,24th May 2019,Not Verified ,"  Worst airport I ever went through. My family of 6 had a connection with British Airways with 90 minutes for us to get from one gate to another after we arrived here from Philadelphia. We missed our flight thank you, the lack of any interest in moving passengers through especially those of us with connections is evident. Nobody sees to care about the customers and travelers passing through here, they just don’t, it’s obvious. This is my last trip to the UK. Good riddance Heathrow."
This airport is a disgrace,2,I Richards,United Kingdom,24th May 2019,Not Verified ,"  This airport is a disgrace. As a UK citizen entering from the US and transiting to Manchester, we arrived in T3 and had to wait about 10 minutes for an operator to attach the airbridge. Once attached, we had a lengthy walk (about 15 minutes) to get to the UK Border and immigration check. Signage was OK but limited. Having been scanned at the ePassport barrier, I thought I was through and into the terminal proper but I was immediately confronted with another bank of scanners and bar code readers - no explanation or instructions. There was an unhelpful and surly security guard who stopped me from walking around these scanners. He told me that I had to (again) remove my glasses and have my photo taken for ""airport security"" - why? I asked him when my data would be removed from Heathrow's system. He gave me the impression he had no idea why I was asking and then glibly agreed with me that it would be deleted when I left the airport. I dont believe it for a moment. Given the recent court case about facial recognition software, where is the policy statement from Heathrow about the usage of our data and how it is protected/deleted? Once through this barrier, another lengthy walk to a bus gate for a long transfer to T5. Why does Heathrow not have a skytrain connecting terminals? After our overnight flight, we were made to wait about 30 minutes until a bus arrived at which point, there was a massive queue of people. The driver of the bus was rude, just packing people into the bus and then driving at quite a speed around a maze of roads to get to T5. We were then confronted with another walk to security where we again went through the usual street theatre of security, overseen by an unsmiling security guard - welcome to the UK. Had I been a foreign visitor, I would not have had a good impression of the UK. Once through the chaos of security, the shopping mall which is T5 was crowded with very few seats available and throngs of confused looking people. Eventually, we got to our connecting gate where our pictures were taken again before we were allowed to board. This airport is horrendous. Having flown in from JFK, I suggest that LHR management take a look at how a proper airport should be run."
"18 processing stations, only 8 were staffed",4,T Irving,Australia,17th May 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Arrived London Heathrow at 8:30 pm. I was in Row 75 on the plane so well back in the Border Force queue. I rarely ever complain, but after a 24 hour flight, I found it really unpleasant to stand for 2+ hours in the ""Non EU"" queue for Border Security Checks. Of about 18 processing stations, only 8 were staffed and sometimes as few as 6 whilst staff had breaks. There were 4 or more staff doing crowd control which seemed more than necessary. I have no problem with the processing staff who were diligently carrying out their work. There just wasn't enough of them rostered on and that's avery poor VERY POOR and needs addressing. This visitor will in future choose to spend my hard earned dollars holidaying somewhere else."
What a nightmare LHR has become,1,Ian Andrews,United Kingdom,16th May 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," What a nightmare LHR has become. We landed in T5 domestic and had to transfer through to international, the line of site signage is almost non existant. There are E gates everywhere, we must have gone through 2 or 3 e gates before we were allowed on our plane. If you have a cap or glasses you can forget it. You just don't need this when you have many things already to carry. The number of the departure gate is not displayed until quite late. We found our plane by the registration and using an app. Seating at departure gate is limited and the boading of the flight was mixed up to say the least. Our return leg was even worse, Passport control was all but un manned there were a few advisors sending everyone to E passport gates and my 16 yo Autistic son was ushered off to another gate. I was allowed through but my son was rejected and told to go and stand in a queue in unaccompanied. I asked why and they said that he was under 18, my son should have been allowed to use E gates according to the heathrow website at the time. Again lots of e gates and photograph taking, no glasses allowed, no caps, etc. And gates not even in logical places. There are some very nice people in the shops but the passport control staff need to have their personalities re installed and learn their own rules regarding e passport gates."
they do not have a clue,1,Steve Vitale,United States,9th May 2019,Not Verified ,  We have traveled extensively and have never found such rude and inconsiderate workers at security. We were told two different things by two different agents. In general they do not have a clue.
good food and good seating,1,K Erwin,United Kingdom,5th May 2019,Not Verified ,"  Airport security were beyond awful for me - slow, careless, thoughtless, unapologetic, and incompetent. Signage isn't just confusing, I found it often incorrect. Best approach is to print out a map and find your own way versus. That said, the airport is modern and clean with relatively good food and good seating."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Ha Nhu Le,United Kingdom,30th April 2019,Not Verified ,"  Heathrow does the job. Even though Heathrow is further than Gatwick we still go to Heathrow to go to Vietnam Airlines. A lot of options to choose from (for breakfast) in terminal 3, the food was delicious and kept us going through the flight. The only thing that I’m a bit miffed about is the long queues! There were two opposite queues, and both were long, 1 longer than the other. But it didn’t matter as we planned ahead our time (5 hours ahead) so we were able to pass security on time. I recommend going to the airport way earlier than you expect, as there are many many queues which take a lot of time. "
sign posting was confusing,7,Gyan Fernando,United Kingdom,22nd April 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Departing and arriving at LHR T2, I found it a little bit frustrating to find my way from and to the Central Bus Station. The sign posting was confusing and the lifts were slow and temperamental. The escalotors are formidable even if you are carrying standard baggage. However, the staff, including Hotel Hoppa bus drivers, are very helpful."
Heathrow is a disgrace,1,H Jackson,United States,8th April 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," 30th Anniversary Rhine River cruise trip, from Amsterdam to Basel. Heathrow was our connecting flight both coming in and returning home. By far the worst airport experience my wife or I have experienced on 'every' level. We are AA Frequent Flyers with Global Security status as well. LHR had the single most unnecessarily invasive, rude, redundant and down right nightmarish security checks & processing of any airport (International or domestic) we've ever encountered. And this was merely for a 'connecting' flight both times wherein we never left the secure area! In fact upon our initial arrival we were so delayed waiting to land then gate docking that we nearly missed connecting flight and were rushed with ""expedited pass"" by airport personnel with small group others yet we were 'still' run through the most rude, confusing and inhuman security checks ever experienced 'just' to get to our connecting flight gate! Really? Barely made our connecting flight and had no time to even use restroom in between all this rush and harassment. Our second Heathrow experience (returning home) was if you can believe it very much worse! Words are not enough to detail that experience and it still literally gives me nightmares and anxiety. The airport security is staffed almost exclusively by employees who almost all seemed to 'profile' travelers and ""run them through the ringer"" in the most rude, abrasive, disrespectful and insulting manner. I have no bias against any person as long they do their job properly and with respect for themselves, others and the institution they represent. The airport itself is horribly inefficient beginning with the bus transfers from arrival to departure gate areas, continuing with confusing signage or especially instructions, and finalized by some of the worst airport staff we've ever encountered in all our years flying. Again this was 'both' times we had to go through Heathrow and experienced by others around us as well, not an isolated incident. Heathrow is a disgrace to air travel & travelers and the fullest example of everything that is wrong today with airports in general. It is quite a shame that Heathrow is meant to be an International hub for so many travelers and thus such a gruelling experience for so many."
poor signage,2,Michael Schade,Germany,5th April 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Heathrow Terminal 5, massive Terminal, poor signage, information counters unmanned, slow and not very friendly security check. Worst were the toilets which were rather dirty. Overall an experience I want to forget."
such a poorly run airport,1,P Payne,United States,27th March 2019,Not Verified ,"  Hopefully, one (and only) positive result of Brexit is that Heathrow will cease to be an international hub and we will no longer have to endure such a poorly run airport. Missed flights, long lines, rude security officials, total incompetence are all at work here. Avoid at all costs. Especially do not attempt a connecting flight here. My family trip from the US to Barcelona was marred by a hellish experience here! Avoid!"
I was very impressed,9,John Rolfe,United Kingdom,20th March 2019,✅ Trip Verified , This was my first time travelling through LHR T2 and I was very impressed. Check in (for EVA Air) was very quick. Security was very efficient and there was a very small wait time. Once airside there is a good choice of shops and restaurants and importantly plenty of seating available. Toilets were clean! Will be happy to use T2 again.
limited seating and limited amenities,3,F Norris,United States,19th March 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," I have not been at Heathrow for many years, and I had to use Terminal 3 for a departure to New York. Not traveling on business this time, I was an economy passenger and I experienced this in such status. Basically, Terminal 3 is just a vast, overpriced shopping mall, crammed with every high-end store imaginable, with limited seating and limited amenities that I could see, e.g., USB charging ports for cell phones. One has to sit in a crowded, central seating area where gates are not announced until around 40 minutes before the boarding time. Once a gate is announced, it can be a 15-20 minute trek to a gate, even with moving sidewalks. And beware, there are very few toilets! The signs for the toilets take you on a yellow brick road kind of odyssey which can encompass a 10 minute walk through a maze of stores, unless I missed something, there is only one near the entrance to the mall after exiting security. There are no toilets near or at the gates, which, as I said, can be very far from the main seating ""pen"" so to speak. Also, the security lines can be long. When the airport web site states ""arrive 3 hours before departure"" there is a very good reason for that. I travel quite a bit internationally, and this is the first airport review I have ever written. But, I feel compelled to do this to warn others. I was very disappointed."
"poor planning, design, and management",3,R Wickersham,Germany,19th March 2019,Not Verified ,"  Poorly designed. After a long bus ride from T3 to T5, it can take up to 30 minutes to get to your gate. The gate for my flight was assigned and posted on the board less than an hour before the thing took off! So fun not knowing just where I needed to be for my flight. Just poor planning, design, and management!"
very well organised and clean,10,Slim Benatia ,United Kingdom,12th March 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," 
Terminal 5 arrivals is very well organised and clean. I love passing through the fast passport control E-gates system. I didn’t wait a lot for my laggage to be delivered. The terminal is very well connected to the other terminals and London."
Avoid going here,1,Taylor Miller,United States,3rd March 2019,Not Verified , The absolute worst airport that I have ever been to. They made me throw away all of my face products because you can only carry on one plastic bag of things. It took 2 hours to get from our first flight to our connecting flight. Absolutely ridiculous. The staff was very rude and disrespectful to me when I had questions. Avoid going here if you can help it.
rude and inconsiderate,3,N John ,United Kingdom,2nd March 2019,Not Verified ,  Airport security staff at terminal 3 are rude and inconsiderate. No customer service skills nor empathy. Unfriendly. Airport management needs to invest more in their staff to increase job satisfaction and maybe hire people who are a better fit in dealing with customers.
such dirty trays used,6,L Nelson,Denmark,27th February 2019,✅ Trip Verified , Really unpleasant with such dirty trays used in Security. Further used for shoes as well as all other belongings that you would normally not expose to “door mat” environment. Does not match a modern western style airport experience.
One of the best airports,10,Allan Foster,United Kingdom,25th February 2019,Not Verified ,"  One of the best airports. Great service, clean and a large variety of shops and restaurants. It would be nice to have aircraft spotting facilities. A third runway is definitely required. I would definitely recommend flying through London Heathrow Airport."
"expect the worst""",3,H Martin,United Kingdom,25th February 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," 
Terminal Two, 7pm on a Thursday evening. Quite possibly the worst airport check in experience ever. We are a family of four with a three year old and a one year old. Check in process is a shambles now with people queuing for four different flights down one lengthy maze of barriers. Only two assistants struggling to cope with the chaos. We were treated like animals, penned into a barrier tape maze for 90 minutes. My wife had to crawl under the barriers with a buggy to go and feed the younger child who was getting quite upset, again no airport staff to advise or assist. Fellow travellers gave up their turn in the queue for us as they could see the effect that this experience was having on the children. The terminal building is clean and well signed but under staffed. If you are going to depart from here, expect the worst and hope for the best."
"Amazing experience""",10,Georgios Efkolidis,United Kingdom,14th February 2019,Not Verified ,"  Amazing experience out of T5. Great fast track security, nice selection of shops and duty free. Never disappoints me. On the way back, a whiz through immigration. Compared to Gatwick or Amsterdam, miles ahead."
quite a good airport,9,C Matthews,United Kingdom,31st January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ,"  As a frequent user living in London I have to say it's quite a good airport nowadays, but with proviso that for transfer travellers I think its pretty awful. Great shops, food options and  security and immigration work quite well. "
easy airport to reach,10,Oliver Andersin,Sweden,24th January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," London Heathrow is great airport, it's easy to find your gate and shopping/food. There is a some differences between the terminals and terminal 5 is the better one. It's the standard a hub terminal should have and BA should be happy to have the terminal since it's in my opinion the best terminal in the world. Terminal 3 is also nice and but not as nice as T5. There is less of assortment there compared to T5 of food and shopping. LHR is a easy airport to reach and check-in and baggage claim is fast. Security can take some time, but never more than 15-30min."
excellent signage throughout,8,N Manson,United States,23rd January 2019,✅ Trip Verified , What's not to like about London Heathrow Terminal 5. We transited here on our way to Athens and again on our way home to Boston. On both occasions the terminal was brightly lit with excellent signage throughout. There are excellent shopping and dining options. The area in the main building to take the trains to the satellite terminals can be crowded resulting in scarce seating. That's understandable given the number of passengers that go through this terminal. WiFi is free (sign up) and its excellent.
Try to avoid!,2,Wolfgang Bernhart,Germany,21st January 2019,✅ Trip Verified , Try to avoid! If you need to change terminals you rely on the trains but those are unreliable because they do not do their maintenance properly. I always prefer AMS which is much better organized!
Terminal 4 is a disgrace,2,Alan Brown,United Kingdom,17th January 2019,Not Verified ,  Terminal 4 is a disgrace. No seating landside except in the expensive coffee shops and restaurants. WiFi doesn't work. Male toilets stink. Poor signage. Only armed Police we saw were hanging round the El Al passenger check-in.
"staff were openly hostile""",1,G Cooper,United Kingdom,15th January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," 
I have traveled to this airport a number of times over the years and confirm that the experience is worse with each year. Today I was traveling from South East Asia to Scotland via Heathrow. Flight arrived on time and we had 4 hours between flights, plenty of time but no it took 1.45 hours to get from terminal 4 to 5 on two buses, then passport control, security, ticket collection, toilet break and we were left with little time between flights. The staff were openly hostile when asked genuine questions when moving between terminals. I also didn’t get to sit with my travel companion for the last flight presumably was because we spent so long getting from terminal 4 to 5. I will avoid Heathrow connection flights going forward. Nobody deserves this kind of service considering the amount we spent on flights. Come on Heathrow get your act together. I’ve given 1 out of 10 and 1 is only for the woman at passport control who was super friendly."
poor experience at security,2,A Owen,United Kingdom,10th January 2019,Not Verified ," Very poor experience at security desks. Rude, shouting aggressive staff with no customer care at all. Unhelpful staff who had the stance that they were doing me a favour being there. Inappropriate comments made to me. First and last time travelling to this airport."
this is not an isolated incident,2,W Reed,United States,9th January 2019,Not Verified ,"  The customs line in December was well over an hour wait. My wife is transitioning planes at LHR (2 Jan 2019) and the she has waited over an hour and still not thru. Therefore, this is not an isolated incident and I will do anything I can to go thru Schiphol, De Gaulle or Frankfurt before I go thru LHR. When I was there they had 2 checkers for hundreds of people. I went thru CDG in Paris 2 weeks later and no issues - only place this is a major chokepoint is Heathrow. I will do everything in my power to avoid Heathrow in thw future."
A great experience,10,David Dale,Australia,8th January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Arrived and departed Heathrow Terminal 3 on Qantas flights QF1 and QF10. Upon arrival in mid December, out the aircraft, through immigration, claimed baggage and out the from door of the terminal within half an hour. Departing early January through Terminal 3, check in and bag drop, through security and to the Qantas lounge within 25 minutes. Boarding was no problem. Terminal 3 has ample duty free shops and cafes/restaurants. Can't complain. A great experience."
no opening times on display,2,Paul Keepax,United Kingdom,8th January 2019,Not Verified ," Would it kill the people involved with Heathrow airport terminal 2 to just show some opening times?. The security desk - no opening times on display. The restaurants - no opening times on display. The shops - no opening times on display. It's hardly rocket science now is it? When you get there early you have to wander the length and breadth and then if you have a smartphone go online and find out what time the places open. It seems none of the restaurants are open at 4.15 when the security desk apparently, and with no announcement and with no signs, opens. Signs, signs, signs people. Get some!"
Well done that terminal,10,Owen Berkeley-Hill,United Kingdom,6th January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," I have commented before about just how well Terminal 5 flows, a characteristic far more important to me than impressive architecture. Compare, for example, how Terminal 5 flows with the clunky, Victorian-minded processes of Mumbai's Terminal 2. Back in the days when dinosaurs ruled, the departure lounges were boring places. You might find a duty-free shop where the prices were twice those on any high street and so one waited until called. I think it may have been the Brits who decided that people waiting to board were a captive audience and so now every airport makes every passenger run the gauntlet of the most inappropriate shops (How am I supposed to stuff an Aston Martin in the overhead bin?). I also suspect the airports, in league with the retailers discouraged passengers from going to their gates. If one is not in the mood to buy 50-year-old single malt or Beluga caviar, one must wait in a crowded hall where seats may be in short supply. Thankfully, Terminal 5 has broken with this practice. Well before a flight's gate is announced, the departure board lets you know the pier from which the flight will depart. The piers at Terminal 5 have ample seating and are much quieter. Well done that terminal!"
such disgusting service,1,N Dawes,United Kingdom,5th January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," The male Immigration Officer sitting at table 31 (Non EU arrival) for my flight from Hanoi to London on the early morning of 4th January 2019 was horribly rude. Maybe he thinks just because he holds the position, he can give himself the authority to bully others around him. I couldn’t get a hold of a pen to fill in my landing form, and reached him. It was my first time travelling alone so I was clueless. I asked if it was ok if I could borrow a pen from him, or from anyone else to complete my form. He slammed my passport and BRP card on the table and started shouting at me in front of everyone. Really? Couldn’t you just have tell me no, go back and fill the form, instead of wasting time bullying and raising your voice at a young girl travelling alone? I turned around to go back to the 2 women in purple to ask for a pen, and he shouted from behind my back from his table. Wow, such disgusting service from an international, world class airport. What is wrong with him? Did the way I look offend him or did he not have breakfast that morning, got hungry and decided to blame it on me? Luckily, the second officer was very gentle and kind. Staff like that guy are a shame to the UK where people are well-known for being so friendly and polite. I set foot on this country and the first impression I got was this big person who bullied me? Disgusting."
could not have been less interested,2,B Davies,United Kingdom,2nd January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," My bag was selected for security check in Terminal 5, which was fine. But staff could not have been less interested in doing the check in a reasonable timeframe. They chatted to themselves, wandered around (at leisurely pace), entered and left the area repeatedly. They never explained why they were not getting on with it. Thank goodness I was early for my flight. They kept us waiting 25 minutes without explanation or apology. A queue of us had built up including a couple with a very young baby. I felt unable to complain at the time as I presume that would have further slowed things and probably singled me out for further checks. The mum of the baby did try to speak to one staff member but as soon as she said ""Excuse me"" he shushed her and said he would be back shortly, and left. He never came back to our area, but stood nearby. She never asked again. What would have helped? Some enthusiasm, empathy, motivation, efficiency, care for their customers, good manners, a smile even. Very disappointing experience."
this airport is the worst,1,E Lewis,United Kingdom,1st January 2019,✅ Trip Verified ," Awful airport. The only airport where my luggage got lost (3 times) and where you regularly spend ages in luggage reclaim because they don't know how to process it. Appaling, in the 18 years I have lived here they haven't got their act together. Then there is the issue of catering, the few ""restaurants"" there are expensive, the food mediocre and the service poor. I no longer dare to sit down anywhere for fear of missing my flight. There are hardly any charging points and the signing is poor. This, ladies and gents, is true for T2 and T5 which are the most modern Terminals in Heathrow. I do travel a lot and this airport is the worst."
staff are lazy and seem annoyed,4,C Cooper,Malaysia,31st December 2018,Not Verified ,"  Arrival at T4, our flight landed at 6:30am and the queue for non-eu immigration took nearly an hour. First impression when we first arrived at Heathrow airport is the old and dull interior. We have been to T2 too and both terminals have friendly and helpful staffs who will always approach us and ask if we need help. Shopping experience is not the greatest in T4, staff are lazy and seem annoyed. If you have several hours before your next flight waiting at T4, better to get a lounge pass because there is limited seats outside the gate."
no individual airline check in desks,2,S Paul ,United Kingdom,25th December 2018,Not Verified ,"  Check in system: Terminal 2 Massive reduction in check in staff. You make your own hold luggage ticket. Then you queue for an hour to actually put the luggage onto the conveyor belt. All the staff work for the same airport company - queue monitors and tagged bag drop staff. There are no individual airline check in desks any more. The queue monitors excitedly tell you they deal with 7 airlines at once. You ask if there are the same, more or less people actually taking your luggage from you as there were before the ""great"" new self service system was introduced. The person repeats that dealing with 7 airlines at the same time, with the fixed smile. Asked again. Same smile - is it improving check-in speed or just increasing their employers profit margins by using less people and making customers suffer - no answer."
extremely slow for the custom clearance,1,Nathan Kwong,Hong Kong,22nd December 2018,Not Verified ,"  It is extremely slow for the custom clearance, in particular non-EU, who have to wait more than 1.5 hours in non-peak hours. It is hard to imagine there are just 10 custom officers serving few hundreds passengers queuing at the same time. London being an international world class city does not deserve to have such a low class airport. Respect is never in the dictionary of Heathrow Airport. It is not surprised Heathrow is one of the most hated airports in the world."
It is not easy to move,2,P Ricci,Italy,28th November 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Milan to Abu Dhabi on Nov 7th and Muscat to Milan on Nov 22nd, both routes via Heathrow terminal 5. It seems that the respect of the passengers is not the goal of this airport: two connections and two changes, at the very last moment, of the gate already shown on the dislpay are intolerable indeed. It is not easy to move, with cabin luggages, from T5A to T5B/T5C or vice versa, considering that the transit train stops are different, not to mention the lifts and the long hallways to go on foot. My cousin is 85 years old and he walks with a limp, I haven't seen any horizontal escalators there."
"Extremely dissatisfied""",1,A Gordon,United Kingdom,28th November 2018,✅ Trip Verified , The staff at this airport are extremely rude. They don’t know how to treat passengers. Just because they have a little bit of power they outright take advantage of it. Extremely dissatisfied.
incredibly rude,1,B Stauffer,South Africa,27th November 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Security at terminal 5 in transit is incredibly rude. Although you have been checked at your departure point, they try to find something to make you miss your flight. You get yelled at for trying to pass with the amenity kit provided on the previous BA flight. Heaven forbid that you have an artificial knee: you are treated like a criminal and get the full search."
had our eyes scanned three times,1,Thomas Kelly,United Kingdom,21st November 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Horrible staff, slow, cant be bothered attitude. My wife and i used LHR few times a year for many years for trips around the globe but after Dublin became more accessible and more airlines came there we stopped using LHR which was a thorn in our previous journeys. October BA had a sale so we decided to go with it, but now we have four young children 7 down to 2. Most countries have airport facilities to help families with stress of security etc but we where shocked at staff in Heathrow, it was if we where a burden and should not be there. We had our eyes scanned three times before getting on the plane."
"Absolute hellhole""",1,T Justi ,Finland,20th November 2018,Not Verified ,"  Absolute hellhole. Had to use Terminal 3 both ways and it seems even more congested and disturbing than before. Nonsense security, metal detecting forever for nothing (little clips in the trousers, which I pointed immediately)asked a million times if I have something in the pockets despite turning them upside down already. I wanted to take scissors and cut my trousers to pieces and ask are you happy now? Had to drag my big pack back and forth because of ""bulky cargo"" apparently. In the end, back to the original belt which seemed to carry my pack after all. Idiots! And even in the lounge, waiting for your gate, it's like torture sitting there constantly bumped, you can't find a place to eat nicely, too much noise for any relaxation whatsoever and incredibly bad air quality. Buses to Gatwick are too expensive and kind of slow too. Terminal 5 perhaps better but a chaos still, based on previous experiences. This was pretty much my only option to go direct from Europe to my destination, otherwise I wouldn't have come through here. Now I regret even that decision. Would have been better to fly to U.S. from somewhere else and take it further from there( Miami, Atlanta etc) , to the caribbean region. Worst airport ever to connect. Nothing is easy, or simple, or improving your athmosphere of travelling."
crowded train to the main terminal,1,D Lawson,United Kingdom,16th November 2018,Not Verified ," Like most BA planes we arrived at a satellite then had to descend into a deep hell hole basement to wait 30 minutes for a crowded train to the main terminal, this is an incredible bad design who on earth worked out such a wasteful and inconvenient layout? At least the baggage had arrived before us."
no idea what good service is,2,J Bagwell,United States,13th November 2018,Not Verified ," After travelling to Heathrow via British Airways, we feel they have no idea what ""good service"" is for the disabled. We were treated like children. Over-protected and under-served. They took away our boarding passes, our us is an out-of-the-way spot with no food, drink, no clock, no display of the flights, and a bored employee. No access to shopping, nor to duty-free. On top of that, I had to stand and wait for wheelchair help and ride buses for long distances. Flight attendants were friendly. I did not like Heathrow."
90 mins to transit from T3 to T5,3,Andy Dusochoix,Belgium,12th November 2018,Not Verified ,"  Just had a poor experience at the airport, took 90 mins to transit from T3 to T5. Travellers had to queue in line under hot airblowers for busses. Everyone was sweating and airport staff were not able to switch off the heating. Lots of travellers were missing their connecting flights"
let down by the security staff,5,Saif Ahmed,United Kingdom,4th November 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," The architecture at Heathrow Airport is wonderful. Open spaces, airy and clean. It's very High-Tech and nearly there with Dubai Airport in terms of aesthetics. Their security staff at Arrivals and Departures are very miserable and rude to the point where they can make you cry/have a panic attack. What they seem to forget that it is a customer facing role as well as protecting the airport. You get shouted at for being overwhelmed by the whole queue line and they are very good at making you feel like a criminal. But the duty free is excellent, with good shops and restaurants. The Harry Potter shop is very nice. It's like going to a premium shopping mall. All other staff are quite friendly (Immigration, Check in, Presentation, Airline Staff etc). It's let down by the security staff. More halal options could be introduced in the food areas but it is a pleasant airport."
have not seen queues and chaos like it,2,Rachael Thomas,United Kingdom,30th October 2018,✅ Trip Verified , Truly terrible at all stages. Arrived at terminal two with plenty of time already checked in online. Told I had to use the check in system to print luggage tags despite being checked in. Computerised check in system didn’t accept my booking reference which had been successfully accepted for me to book in online. Ushered to checkin helpdesk. Two desks out of around 6 open with around 30-40 in the queue. No apology for long long delay through slow service and lack of desks. Security was even worse. I have not seen queues and chaos like it. Closing the initial gates before security splitting travelling families and colleagues apart. Then really really long queues with unopened security belts. Exceedingly poor. I would recommend turning up a mim of 3 hours before
instructed to get out of wheelchair,2,Lloyd King,United Kingdom,21st October 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  We are travelling with my disabled elderly mother who is subjected to frequent falls and needs a wheelchair from the car. No wheelchair where parking/drop off point is, I had to walk into airport to find the wheelchair. At security check mum was instructed to get out of wheelchair, stand with arms above her head and be xrayed. No help was offered or given at anytime. She also had to remove her valcro disability shoes. This was all executed in an unnecessary, disrespectful and embarrassing manner and caused her some distress. As mum is 78yrs old, born and bred in the UK, worked as a health care practitioner caring for others, all her life. Did she really deserve to be treated is this undignified way? How can she be perceived as being a threat to anyone?"
45 minutes through security,1,S Goodchild,Azerbaijan,2nd October 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," The security screening in departures Terminal 4 must be the worst organised I have experienced in any airport. First of all the so called “Fast track” was basically on stop and staff sitting around talking and laughing with each other while passengers were standing waiting. Staff were asked why there was no movement but there was no answer given. After 10 minutes we turned back to go through general security, after putting bags on the scan machine belt and waiting at the other side the machine came to a standstill and the bags stopped coming. Security staff looked at the scan monitor and discussed something for a while then decided to take the bags off and put them on another scan belt. The staff on the scan belt that was not working then decided to sit around again laughing and joking - one big happy family but a lot of disgruntled passengers. 45 minutes trying to get through security at 19.00hrs whrn it’s not busy is a joke"
security staff at Heathrow are the rudest,3,G Miller,United Kingdom,20th September 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," We only had one issue with the airport and that was a lady who worked on security. She clearly does not enjoy her job and should not be allowed near members of the public. She refused to allow me through as only 2/3 of my zip lock liquids bag would close. I asked if she could assist and she refused and told me to throw an item away. She was visibly irritated with myself and my partner thoughout the process. If I was not reliant on getting through and it was any other service related industry I would have complained immediately. This is an issue at Heathrow, in the last year I have flown from several airports, security staff at Heathrow are the rudest I have ever encountered, it makes the start of a holiday a stressful experience."
Avoid Heathrow,1,E Blankenship,United States,13th September 2018,Not Verified ,"  I had a very unpleasant experience with a security agent in Terminal 5. Our family was traveling home from holiday, our airline changed our flights home last minute putting us on a connecting flight through Heathrow. We were unaware of their ‘liquids in one bag’ security rule. My toiletries were in my carry one. The agent was visibly irritated with me. My liquids wouldn’t fit in the plastic bag she provided me. She rudely told me ‘I should have checked their rules before coming’. I explained our flights were changed and I had no previous problems with security in Italy airport where we just came from. A little empathy would have been nice but instead the agent was rude and unprofessional. Avoid Heathrow!"
"This is clearly unacceptable""",1,R Pearce,United Kingdom,8th September 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Arrived on the EVA Air flight from Bangkok on 5th September at 19.25pm at Terminal Two. Having passed through immigration quite quickly, I was shocked to wait over an hour and 40 minutes for our baggage to arrive. This is clearly unacceptable when following an eleven and a half hour flight one has to wait such an additional length of time before starting the journey home. The baggage belt was shared by a flight from Beijing, and when we arrived at the designated belt, the Bangkok flight belt was still awaiting baggage. Even when it arrived, it was in dribs and drabs, the premium economy of course coming out first. Then the belt stopped for ten minutes and when it restarted, there were never more than a dozen or so bags on it at any time. The inefficiency of the baggage service must really create a very bad impression for any foreign visitors. On this trip, we could compare the baggage service on arrival at Bangkok (twice), Chiang Mai and Hong Kong. Although of course Heathrow is far bigger, the staffing levels clearly are not sufficient to operate the required service to a competent level of efficiency."
VAT counter not fully staffed,1,N Jarudin,Canada,27th August 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I was at Terminal 3 on August 24, 2018 and had to wait 1hr and 50 mins to get my VAT refund. It was at the height of the tourist season and yet the VAT counter was not fully staffed. Frustration ran high and several travelers almost missed catching their flights. Surely Heathrow can do better than this. "
security staff were rude,1,K Buenver,Sweden,26th August 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Departing from Terminal 2, 23 Aug 2018. Passing the fast track security check at about 16:00. The staff were rude and unprofessional. For passengers, specially transit passengers, LHR appears to be an airport to avoid."
a modern day dystopia,3,Brian McKenzie,United Kingdom,4th August 2018,Not Verified ," After an efficient transition I entered the secure departure area of Terminal 3. This is as close to a modern day dystopia one might get to outside a Mad Max movie, noisy, overcrowded, hot and humid, forced to run the gauntlet of overpriced useless shops cashing in on holiday hysteria. Having slunk off the endlessly circulating stream of humanity to an over bright Italian resturant where they inject the waitresses with Botox leaving a rictus smile. Here the Bolognese was awful salvaged only by a decent coffee. I am a veteran of Gatwick so should not scare easy but was assailed at all levels. Still looking for a quiet place to call home. Will I come again, no, even if it means not flying with BA ever again."
I wasted a lot of time,7,Edoardo Ansarin ,Italy,1st August 2018,Not Verified ,"  I arrived at Heathrow airport from Milan Linate with an Alitalia flight so from an European country. When I arrived I had to go to the toilets and it wasn't close so I had to walk a lot. Then I had to go to the passports control and there was a long queue. Then I moved to the baggage reclaim and even though I waited a lot at the controls, my baggage hadn't arrived yet. I was angry because I waited for my baggage for 40 minutes. I took my baggage and I moved to take the underground to reach London. Of course Heathrow is a very good and modern airport, but I wasted a lot of time in the queue for the passport control even though I arrived from an EU country. I hope that the next time I go here, it will take less time."
"had already been misguided""
",1,T James,United Kingdom,31st July 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Beware of the misguided flashing orange sign redirecting your driving lane so that all who are entering to Terminal 2 end up having to park and not simply drop off Passengers. I now recall this happened to me about a year ago. It should be clearer, it is obvious Heathrow is misguiding all Drop Off Passenger vehicle drivers, so that they take the wrong lane and so having to park in the Car Park which is the lane taking you into a 'one way' system so that - to scam revenue from you! Be careful and only follow the black and white printed signs when going into Terminal 2 Passenger Drop off. I was scammed out of £11.00 this morning - having to eventually park up and take my sister into the Terminal, being that I had already been misguided into the car park."
"generally spacious, and uncrowded",7,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,30th July 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," I can never understand the amount of negative press that Terminal 5 at LHR gets - it is generally spacious, and uncrowded. It isn't the over priced shopping mall that all the other Terminals seem to be. However, it was noticeable that checking into BA most of the check in desks have now gone, and been replaced by self service kiosks. We were travelling Club and the resulting queues at Club World Check In were consequently much larger than before as we are told at online check in that we must go to a check in desk to complete the formalities ! A backward (but no doubt cost saving) step. Still, by no means the worst airport."
unprofessional and rude,2,Donald Marks,United States,26th July 2018,Not Verified ,"  Flight AA733, 7/23/2018 The security procedure at Terminal 2 for connecting passengers was unprofessional and rude. The lines were too long for connecting passengers - official guidance states that 1 hour is enough, security alone took that much time, plus time to transit terminals, and board the airplane. One security officer was even stating that ""since you didn't follow our directions, we are going to search everything in your bag"". This type of deliberate delay is unprofessional. These people already passed through security, and are unfamiliar with UK regulations. We were doing the best we could under the circumstances. In my case, after waiting 20 minutes, I was told my cough syrup had to be approved by a supervisor, but one was not called for the next 20 minutes (the flight departure time), so I finally just gave up and told them to keep it. They then rummaged through my bag and let me go. This last search, as well as the extra wait, was vindictive, rude, and frankly hostile. I expected better behavior from security personnel."
one of my better experiences at LHR,7,Robert Marshall,United Kingdom,22nd July 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Departure T2: easy to locate TAP bag tag print points. Once attached, very short queues for bag barcode scanning and bag drop. TAP points manned by pleasant staff. Off to security. Fairly lengthy queues which kept moving. Security staff were the usual grim-faced ones. Post security the usual expensive 'duty free' shops and plenty of expensive food/drink places. Plenty of seating. Toilets were OK mid-morning. Signage was fine. Usual lengthy walk to departure gate. Very limited seating at departure gate. Air bridge available. Gate staff were OK. Arrival T2: The usual long taxi at LHR + additional wait for gate. Airbridge available. Signage was fine. Usual long walk to UK border. Used e-border about 50% of which were switched on. 3 out of 4 of us e-border worked fine. 1 had to queue up at passport control as machine would not recognise. Bags just coming onto baggage reclaim as we got there. Toilets were looking quite tired by late afternoon/early evening. No cleaners about. All in all, one of my better experiences at LHR."
incredibly rude and surly,1,C Martin,New Zealand,11th July 2018,Not Verified ,"  Though we were tired from our long journey, my family and I were initially very excited when we arrived at Heathrow for our UK holiday. However when we arrived at the immigration area we had to wait in an incredibly long queue for 3 hours to get through with our NZ passports, while we watched other people go through the UK/EU side of the immigration area without having to wait in any queues. There were quite a few officials in purple jackets standing around talking to each other and not seeming to be doing anything, couldn't they have done something to help the many people waiting in the queue? To top it off, when we finally made it to the front of the queue the security guard who stamped our passport was incredibly rude and surly. Never have I felt more unwelcome as a visitor in another country than when I went through Heathrow. If I ever come back to the UK I will definitely be avoiding Heathrow airport."
situation is extremely unjust,2,Law Wong,Hong Kong,4th July 2018,Not Verified ,"  
London does not have a Value Added Tax deduction service. While stores may emphasize that VAT will be returned to you at the airport while shopping, this is not the case. The queue at the VAT return desk prior to check-in is two hours long, making it practically impossible to obtain VAT. No additional counters were set up to handle peak flow. The (unadvertised) VAT return desk after customs has a shorter queue, but one must remember to keep all their goods in their carry-on baggage, which is not possible unless one is familiar with the airport. This situation is extremely unjust (I daresay exploitative). VAT returns were promised as an incentive to shop, but the system was set up in such a way as to prevent such claims from being made. The situation could readily have been rectified by setting up additional counters for peak flow to limit wait times to a more reasonable duration of perhaps thirty minutes (to deter truly frivolous claims). This situation reflects poorly on the management at Heathrow Airport."
there is lots of signs,9,M Fermin,United Kingdom,28th June 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Friendly staff, although big airport there is lots of signs to make sure you won't get lost. Wide selection of restaurants, fast foods. Very clean, but seats could be a bit more comfortable. Security check in queuing was pretty quick."
a very modern and clean airport,8,J Morris,United States,22nd June 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Heathrow is a very modern and clean airport, it feels very secure, and it offers plenty of things to do before your flight. Security did not feel hectic and everyone was very polite. You do have to walk anywhere from 3 to 25 minutes to your gate so please keep that in mind if you’re traveling with someone elderly or with walking difficulties. They do offer a “buggy” service to take you to and from the gate however it is not conveniently located. Overall I really like this airport because you feel very safe."
the process painfully slow,2,W Saunders,Cambodia,19th June 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Avoid travelling from LHR T2 if possible. Otherwise, allow around two hours to check in (digital) and drop off your bags (human operator) and around one hour to get through security, and that's on top of the two to three hours usually recommended. The system was shambolic and the process painfully slow. Infrequent travellers will likely find the experience quite stressful, while business class upwards seem to be processed without delay. As an infrequent traveller, I found the signage and directions inadequate - in the lifts when getting to T2 - which lift to use, what floor to get out on, what floor the lift was at, at check-in, there was no obvious signage explaining the universal queuing system or the need to get your own baggage label from a machine, the queue to drop off bags was very long and snaked around the place, so get a trolley - not only for your bags but for also for something to rest against! Security was impossibly slow. At one point, all the queues seemed to be full. The queue I was in barely moved until another machine was opened after asking three members of staff to try and speed things up. One traveller was overheard saying he had just ten minutes to get to the gate and was told he'd have to queue, which seems unreasonable when the facility to fast track some travellers exists. Surely this is not the kind of customer experience envisaged in 2014 when a representative reportedly stated that the customer would be at the centre of the terminal's design! Any investment in facilities matters little when travellers emerge from check-in and security stressed with insufficient time to browse the stores, enjoy a meal or even a cup of tea, not to mention use the bathroom facilities. On the other hand, nearly all the members of staff were terrific - helpful, courteous, professional and understanding. The problem was that they were too few. In short, many check-in machines, drop-off desks and security scanners stood idle and human operators were in short supply while customers lugged bags around a cordoned maze and queued for hours at both check-in and security. LHR should be able to do better than this. In contrast, Phnom Penh International Airport was very efficient, with clear signage. sufficient staff and quick processing through immigration and baggage pick-up. I rather suspect that LHR managers/decision makers should listen to and learn from the staff."
lack of staff is very noticeable,3,J Harris,United Kingdom,7th June 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," 
Very disappointed. The priorities at London Heathrow are totally wrong. There is no attempt whatsoever to ease things for families right from the moment you unboard the train, right through passport control and until you claim your baggage. 1) All airports I can recall let you claim your stroller at the airplane. At London Heathrow not only do you no get that service but you don't even get it with the baggage. It comes out of from a completely different belt. My baggage came out from belt 5 and the stroller came out of belt 11 which is at the other side of the airport and of course I had to ask to find out. Worse still there are not staff to ask so that took an additional 5 minutes to find someone. At Zurich airport I was told it would come out with the luggage. 2) Passport control is virtually empty for epassports yet very crowded and run by 3 members of staff only for those who have to use the manual process, ie families, disabled and children. This begs the question as to who should get priority? Families with crying children who have perhaps just endured a potentially 12 hour flight or normal adults who can better cope with travelling or the disabled? Please think and get your priorities right like the rest of the world! 3) Baggage claim- please treat peoples' property with respect. The buggies were literally chucked around with one buggy visibly broken from lack of care when handling. I saw how they handled these at Zurich airport and Antalya. A dedicated member of staff picked them up and delivered them to the plane door whereas at Heathrow they were clearly not handled in the same way. Fortunately the broken buggy was not mine this time but it was mine last year. 4) The lack of staff is very noticeable. It seems the cuts are even visible at the airport. I wonder whether there is a lack of security staff too? I should hope not but it is likely to be the case. I think the management of Heathrow airport truly lets the nation down. It is a visibly beautiful airport, that is clean, big and respectable but is immensely let down by the very poor service and poor management."
"miserable, hot, uncirculated air""",1,B James,United States,6th June 2018,Not Verified ,"  
My wife and I flew into Heathrow yesterday after a 10-hour flight. We walked for what seemed like at least a mile before we entered a roped off sea of humanity in miserable, hot, uncirculated air indoors. I estimate at least 1,500 people were slowly moving their way through a human corral waiting for approval to collect their luggage and go on their way. Some of the most insulting and intimidating features were the signage, obviously cooked up by some right-wing PR-industrial psychology firm. Large ""UK BORDER"" signs seemed to say keep out near the front of the crowd. The signs gave the impression of a wall Donald Trump would have been proud of. I told my wife had I known this kind of treatment would be our welcome, then I wouldn't have bothered a stay in London. After well over an hour of this torture, soaked in sweat, we finally were herded up to the glass enclosed immigration man. There was air conditioning here. He lobbed off a series of rude questions that ended with what is the purpose of your travel. Holiday, I replied. How many days, the I-man asked. Three, I replied. Well that's not much of a holiday, he sassed. Well, we're off to France after that, I said. How many days total, he said. Ten, I replied. He then snatched our passports, loudly stamped them and gestured us on. Yeah, I whispered to my wife as we walked away, we'll spend more of our time and money in a real country."
worst I have ever experienced,3,K Morrell,United Kingdom,4th June 2018,❌ Not Verified ,"  
Arrival at Border Control last night was the worst I have ever experienced. Long queues of people we waited over an hour to be processed. All EU and non EU citizens were expected to queue together alongside small children (including our own) that are not allowed to be processed via the scanning machines unless they can do it themselves! Total chaos. When I asked why we were all queuing together instead of separate isles I was informed all the flights that were queuing were from EU countries but then I said we had Japanese and Indian passport holders in our queue as well as other International passport holders. The Border man said they must of been in the wrong queue then to which I replied well you have one man directing everyone into one queue there isn’t another queue! This is all down to funding cuts which leads to appalling processing services at our Border Control for U.K. citizens not much of a welcome home."
he signage is awful,4,A Metherell,New Zealand,3rd June 2018,❌ Not Verified ,"  Arrival into Heathrow T3 was dirty, poor lighting, antiquated decor. The signage is awful. We followed signage for hotel buses. This took us outside where we saw no directions.  We had to ask several people where the pick up was and luckily a bus driver took pity on us and helped. "
I did not feel welcome,1,G Richards,United Kingdom,18th May 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," 
Our plane landed on time and we disembarked at 8.35 and were in a queue out the door and around the corridor and then in the arrival hall for more than 2.5 hours, waiting for our passports to be checked. I have indefinite leave to remain and reside in the UK, but most of the people were tourists. They were tired and many of us were travelling alone with no way to get out of the queue to use the toilet. It was a long haul flight. We were brought water to drink. The border agent did not speak to me except to say ‘glasses off’. Of course I thanked her and she said nothing in reply. I did not feel welcome. Our bags were on the floor by the time we arrived in the baggage claim area and the plane info was no longer displayed. People were confused and it was difficult to find anyone to ask for information."
security system is ridiculous,1,Diane Renter,Canada,18th May 2018,❌ Not Verified ,  The only reason we were at London Heathrow Airport was because of a connection we had to make on our way to Germany. Their security system is ridiculous! We had to go through security/immigration even though we were just passing through. The people working there were probably the rudest we've ever encountered. There was also no signage coming in from the plane as to what direction we had to go. We will never go through London again in future travels. Their staff need a lot of training in PR skills!
always a breeze,8,Kuhan Kandiah,Malaysia,16th May 2018,❌ Not Verified ,  Arrival and departure from LHR Terminal 4 is always a breeze minus the possible long lines at immigration especially arrivals post 7am. Shopping is affordable and food and retail outlets are sufficient. One thing lacking is the signage for the Underground from the departure level. Otherwise so much improvements have been done at Terminal 4 for the better.
give yourself plenty of time,5,J Measen,United States,14th May 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I think what is best said is, Heathrow is Heathrow. It is a massive airport and you must give yourself plenty of time to move between terminals. We flew into 5 and out of 3, with the reverse on our return flight. Everywhere you go there are throngs of people with few if any quiet areas. The really odd thing about Heathrow is that they have very small seating areas around the gates. On our flights I would guess maybe 50 seats for a plane that holds 200 passengers. To accommodate this, they tend to not tell you which gate you will be leaving from until 10-15 minutes before boarding. On our flight to Prague, the board indicated that the gate would be announced 10 minutes before boarding, but some of the gates in the ""B"" category were 20 minutes away! Luckily, ours was closer than that, but it seems like a strange way of doing things."
Very understaffed and poor communication,2,Olive Hall,United Kingdom,5th May 2018,❎ Not Verified ,  Arrived from Glasgow on Sunday 1st April to terminal 5. Had to wait over an hour for our luggage to arrive. Poor communication about reason for this. Then when we returned on Wednesday 18th April from Washington DC we had to wait on plane after landing for more than an hour. Our flight transfer was on to Glasgow. The directions for flight transfers were poorly signposted and a long walk away. Then we were delayed further by long queues at security. I always have small bag of about 4 toiletries less than 50ml in a clear plastic bag outside my bag which goes through security without delay and have never been stopped in my many travels. I was detained and had to wait for a long while just so someone could weigh this bag. Don't know why. Very understaffed and poor communication again. I will avoid this airport in future.
too small for its purpose,6,michael oon,United Kingdom,29th April 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Terminal 2 is the newest Terminal in London’s Heathrow complex. Again, it is showing signs of being too small for its purpose. This terminal is exclusively for the Star Alliance group of airlines. Departure: Although we had checked in online, we had to join the queue to be checked in properly. That involved a wait for us of about 45 mins. Once through this, the security check, it was plain sailing to the boarding of the aircraft. Arrivals: It was a smooth passage through the Border controls until the luggage reclaim. We had to wait more than 60 minutes to get our luggage. There was the new smart luggage carousel. It would only dispense an additional bag on to the belt when there was a free slot. It came to a point where the belt was full and no new bags could be dispensed. Presumably, the delay was because passengers were held up by the immigration procedures. These existing bags on the belt were presumably from passengers who had been delayed. Surely, someone in the planning department would have thought of a hold up in the chain (i.e. seizure of the flow of passengers) and no bags were being collected from the carousel? In this case, is the latest technology the most suitable route to take? It was certainly frustrating to see the same bags going round and round and no new bags being added. A large crowd of passengers was waiting and venting their frustration. Eventually, the bags were being removed by the delayed passengers and the new bags dispensed onto the belt. We finally got ours after a wait. Our usual time to go through Heathrow is usually 1 hour. This time it was 2 hours. It was a disappointing experience in Heathrow’s latest terminal."
rest of the terminal is very nice,8,Martin Bailey,United Kingdom,19th April 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  Have been using Terminal 2 on a regular basis for short haul flights in Europe since January, and most impressed. Whilst the check in area can get busy at peak morning times, the rest of the terminal is very nice and a real step up for Heathrow. Only once have I had to transfer here, that from T4 to T5 and I would agree that Heathrow is not a customer friendly airport for that process - but still a lot better than the dreadful Paris CDG or Frankfurt!"
"updating their computer systems""",1,S Simpson,United States,14th April 2018,❎ Not Verified ,"  Sat on tarmac at Athens international airport on April 9th 2108, for almost one hour because London Heathrow tower was updating their computer systems and thus causing everyone to sit on the plane with nothing to do, causing a 3.5 hour flight to turn into 4.5 hour flight with no food offered on British Airways while waiting."
efficient and clean terminal,8,Nathan Greener,United Kingdom,12th April 2018,❎ Not Verified , Terminal 5 at Heathrow is very clean and new it has lots of big shops and lots of places to eat! To go to the the gates for long-haul flights there is a small computer operated train that takes you to those gates. There are also lots of seats and info boards dotted around the place. Overall a very efficient and clean terminal.
Queues were incredibly slow,2,W Li,United Kingdom,10th April 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Had a delay with flight which meant we had an hour to make it to our connecting flight. We told the ground transfer staff within Terminal 3 and they told us to get to back of the queue and said they couldn't do anything. They weren't even polite about it. Queues were incredibly slow and the staff were rude and looked like they just didn't want to be there. I don't think they understand customer service. My mother got yelled at for not knowing how to use the passport scanner to get through, she understands limited english and the staff member who stood there (which I assume is there to assist people) tutted at my mother and rolled her eyes when I asked if she could assist my mother. This made me so angry. Why were they even there if it was such a chore to assist members of the public? Ridiculous. Security queues are long and slow and you can understand why, because staff members don't care. We were standing at the queue which also allowed Priority Members - but it only just joined our queue which was inefficient. I've been through many airports and I can honestly say that Heathrow contains the most inefficient, incompetent and incredibly rude staff members. It doesn't hurt to have good manners."
"prolonged, unnecessarily long",4,K Shaw,United Kingdom,5th April 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," We flew to Calgary from Manchester with BA via Terminal 5. No issues with onward journey, great service and a smooth transition though T5. However on the return journey we were reminded of as to why we avoid BA via T5. The flight service from Calgary was ordinary, I have come to realise this is largely dependent on the crew team. Transition through T5 is prolonged, unnecessarily long. One has to go through passport control and security again, adding an hour of frustration as having to queue in line as one is not allowed to use the automated passport control with kids. To top this another security check which is completely unnecessary for a tea sitting passenger if one gets the pathway right. Whilst I appreciate the need for passport checks which may be unavoidable as this is the first port of entry in to UK and one is then mixed with domestic passengers repeat security check, unnecessary. Ground staff, some very rude! Poor show T5."
staff so slow and incompetent,10,S Griffin,Ireland,5th April 2018,❎ Not Verified ," Was flying from Sweden to Cork, stopped off in Heathrow for transfer, the staff were so slow and incompetent I missed my connecting flight, most staff are unfriendly and unhelpful, worst airport ever for customer experience. Getting WiFi was even a problem."
"staff are rude and unhelpful""",2,R Johnson,United States,4th April 2018,❎ Not Verified ,"  The transfer from terminal 4 to terminal 3 is terrible. The staff are rude and unhelpful. The security is incredibly slow. I travel frequently and this was my worst experience over the past 10 years. They have an awful 4 person at a time bag security check that makes everyone go the speed of the slowest of the four, very inefficient with grumpy staff as a result."
the terminal is clean,8,S Norton,United Arab Emirates,4th April 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Transited in LHR T5. Although it is a standard procedure to pass through security even on transit flights (coming from Dallas and Houston I thought its security is strict enough to be sufficient), this takes considerable time. If the transit is less than 45 minutes ones loses the next flight. Apart from this the terminal is clean, nice, with plenty of convenient outlets. British Airways lounge is almost always packed but new, functional and well catered."
not impressed with its functionality,4,Geoff Clay,United Kingdom,3rd April 2018,❎ Not Verified ,"  First time visiting T2 and not impressed with its functionality. It's the simple things that maybe look good but do not work well and create frustration. The short term car park lifts are all operated by the usual up or down call button but it is very difficult to see which one of the several lifts actually arrives unless you stand well back which makes for a mad rush by everyone to the set of doors that open. Inside the lifts there is a very poor screen showing which floor the lift has stopped at, it seems to be some type of LED sign that you cannot read unless you are at exactly the right angle so most lift passengers have to call out and ask ""which floor now?"" The departure hall has many screens showing which check-in zone etc but the exact extend of each zone is unclear, is this queue in C or D etc.. common sense says it would be better to colour code seperate zones and where are the toilets, I could not see any signs in departures other than a single unisex cubicle outside by the car park lifts and nobody around to ask. In the arrivals hall there are signed toilets at each end and they were clean but what a stupid type of hand-drier, there are ""wings"" on each tap at the individual sinks and once the washing has been done then the water stops and hot air is blown downwards. Novel idea but unfortunately all this airstream initially does is blast the remaining water in the sink upwards onto the unsuspecting handwasher, why get rid of the functional wall mounted driers used successfully throughout the world? Finally - on each floor by the lifts there are 4 payment machines but this lunchtime two were broken on level 3 so both remaining ones had a long queue, this just happened to push me (and probably others) over into another hour and an extra £3+ are our computer systems so bad or is this a discreet way they make more money? After being open for nearly 4 years its a pity that superficially it looks good but in practice it contributes to Heathrow's poor reputation."
terrible first impression for tourists,3,E Cooper,United States,26th March 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Arrived at Heathrow from Paris. Long walk to ""UK Border"" for American passport holders. Stood in an even longer line for American passport holders to get to the ""border"". So hot, turn on some ac please. Terminal 4 looks old and obsolete, terrible first impression for tourists. Collect info on arrival times so you can have enough people working at your border. Border agent was pleasant enough at least. Stop treating guests and visitors entering your country like animals, we.came here to visit and enjoy England; not to be treated badly."
the very worst airport,2,J Burton,United States,23rd March 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," This is the very worst airport I have ever been to. I agree with other reviewers, they really try to make the experience the worst. Our first flight was awful but the second takes the cake. We have just under 2 hours to make our connection after landing from Portugal before going to US. To change terminals there is a line you get in. You have non compassionate, non conforming people managing the crowd. We were sent to a room for American Airlines customer service. They said for document check. What, you ask, we just came off an international flight. Then we realize the customer service only wants to help those who need to rebook. Luckily, we caught a girl and she said we could go get in line for security to go to terminal 3. The line is over 500 long. We ask one of the purple staffed hall crowd controllers about moving to an express line before we miss our flight now in 45 minutes. She said no worries, they will rebook you! You have to wait! I said I don’t need to be rebooked if I can move up. She repeated no problem they will rebook you! So we wait and go through security with folks, they all want different things. Take your shoes off, leave them on, no take that off. No consistency. Afterwards, we see gate departures. We see our flight is closing under status! My 70 year old mom is not that fast. I take all her stuff and run to the gate to try to hold it for us. We get to gate, there are 5 others flushed from running. My mom makes it and they pull us for another pre flight bag check! We make it on board out of breath and there are 20 others coming in also out of breath, clearly getting stuck in the same mess. "
it feels a bit crammed,8,Angelo Menezes,Portugal,14th March 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," I transferred from T5 to T3 and what a difference. T5 is all spacious and gracious, but getting to T3 is rather confusing with all the narrow corridors and all the makeshift buildings. Once you are in, it feels a bit crammed, given the amount of people, but it is not that bad. There is a good option of shops and restaurants, for the ones who might be interested. My favorite part of the transit was taking the bus between terminals - alas! - with the driver's radio playing ABBA and other 80s music."
Going through security was painless,8,Michael Oon,United Kingdom,11th March 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," The refurbished Terminal 3 at London Heathrow is now fit for purpose, of the highest international standards. The check in at the Cathay Pacific Desk was smooth with helpful staff behind their desks. Going through security was painless. The queues kept moving all the time and the procedure itself was painless. After that, it was a march to the Lounge less than 20 minutes after arriving at the Terminal."
It did not seem an orderly process,8,O Martin,United Kingdom,6th March 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Terminal 4 has been refurbished since British Airways transferred to Terminal 5. There are a variety of airlines unlike Terminals 2 and 3 which are specific to their airline alliance (Terminal 2 Star Alliance and Terminal 3 One World Alliance). Checking in: This was done at the desk, the old-fashioned way. I did not notice any significant number of automated checks in counters. Perhaps I missed it. Going through Security: Now that Heathrow Airport has got their act together with regards to the process of getting passengers through security screening quickly and painlessly. They have invested in more screening bays and people to do the work. We got through security easily and without taking off our shoes. What a relief. We then went to the lounge. There were plenty of branded shops, but we have visited them so many times so we gave it a miss. Boarding Process: It did not seem an orderly process. It involved a full flight for a super Jumbo A380 of about 500 passengers. Malaysia Airlines boards by seat numbers with the passengers at the back going in first. The point being, there are people who can see that the boarding process has started but they do not know exactly what is happening. There is no obvious signage or clear audio announcements to inform passengers the exact situation. Because they are not sure of the announcements, anxious for more information about their situation, they moved to the front. As a result, the area around the boarding area is packed with people. This full plane load of people blocks the main hall where other passengers have to cross to catch their respective flights. This is not a very civilised manner to board a plane in a modern-day airport. Malaysia Airlines should have clear signage to show exactly what is happening. Say this is where to queue for rows x to y etc. in contrast to the mayhem when I was boarding."
Heathrow airport is a nightmare,3,D Jones,United Kingdom,3rd March 2018,❎ Not Verified ,"  Heathrow airport is a nightmare. I am a UK national, and it’s a national disgrace. As for the transfer between terminals 4 and 5 it’s a joke. A cattle truck would do better. The security staff are rude and high handed and signage is garish and confusing. Whatever happened to customer care? Compared to Schipol it’s a shambles."
their rules and have to be followed,2,Chuck Berlin,United States,13th February 2018,✅ Trip Verified ,"  I have never seen more poorly managed flight connections area than in LHR. A focus is to ensure that the proper size liquid/cream containers fit into the proper size plastic bag - these are their rules and have to be followed. The problem occurs when a bag is rejected and gets segregated for secondary screening. The secondary screening process is a time consuming joke - it took the inspector over 12 minutes to check the knapsack. During this period, the segregated luggage started to back up. Not at any point did a supervisor add an additional inspector or help speed up the process. The woman who helped me told me that ""this happens all of the time"". Complaining to the airport is an exercise frustration as you know nothing is going to be accomplished by this. You are also asked to rate the service by pushing one of a variety of ""faces"" ranging from a bright yellow smile to a red frown - another exercise in futility."
I was met with a rude shrug,3,Katherine Bradley,Qatar,27th January 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," Absolutely awful immigration process for families. There was one officer dealing for the queue which was long. We understand that you have to sometimes queue but the thing that made the process ludicrous was the officer, sat at e-gate desk. She flatly refused to take any of families through immigration even though she sat there for about 10 minutes with no e-gate travellers. When I asked our sole immigration officer on the families queue, ""why?"" he told me she could not deal with us just in case 1000 people arrived at once! I said that seemed highly inefficient given she sat there leaning back on her chair for ten minutes and in other airports e-gate officials are able to take other passengers on down time. I was met with a rude shrug and a you just have to accept it. Really I feel like their is some target in Heathrow airport about how horrible you can make experience for passengers. I spoke to the people at Qatar Airways baggage handling and they agreed that Heathrow has a particular problem with how they treat people."
car parking at this terminal is a nightmare,5,Angelika Bolton ,United Kingdom,21st January 2018,❎ Not Verified ,  Every time we use car parking at this terminal it is a nightmare. On 17.01.18 we tried to pay by debit visa card in a few different places and floors to finally work out that the machine does not accept pin numbers but only accepts contactless payment. How would I know this if the error message says Visa Debit not accepted? Have been in the airport 15 minutes and spent another 20 minutes running around and trying to pay for the car parking which made me stay over 30 min and therefore more money to pay!
"very rude and unprofessional""",4,N Davis,United States,14th January 2018,✅ Trip Verified , I was transiting from Amsterdam to Boston through T3. Security staff were very rude and unprofessional. Just yelling at everyone one like it was a boot camp. No respect whatsoever. Your only allowed one small zip lock of liquids under 100mls. When I asked why I was able to carry the same amount of liquid from Amsterdam I was told people in US and other countries don’t do their jobs that’s why. I had NyQuil caps for cold and they were thrown away considered liquid in a capsule. I almost missed my flight just as I spent 45 min for someone to recheck my liquids. Unless there is no other option I will never transit though UK. Worst experience ever!
No prior warning is given,3,Alex Shafarenko,United Kingdom,13th January 2018,✅ Trip Verified ," If you drive to Heathrow T2 you will see signs to ""Passenger pick up"" at least twice (see photos) and if you follow them, you come to a car park still signposted as both a car park and a pick up point. Take a ticket, pick up whoever you are meeting there and when you are about to leave (having spent a total of 6 min none of that time in parked state) you will be charged £12 purportedly for a two-hour stay. No prior warning is given, and a lengthy correspondence with customer support staff will bear no fruit. This is a kind of mousetrap designed to charge an unsuspecting customer for a service he neither wanted nor received."
"security shouted at me""",7,Laurie Sicard-Askey,Malta,29th December 2017,✅ Trip Verified ," This is a review of the security check at Terminal 4. I was indicated to use the far right security pass-through where some of the staff were barking out orders for the procedures. I was forced to use the last position to place my stuff in the grey trays as two others were before me. For some reason there was a hold-up for a few minutes, then the process proceeded. Two more people came in to fill the gaps left by the two before me as I was stuck at the back of the queue so I tried to push my two trays left in the gap before the two newbies could push in but the security guard shouted at me to stop pushing. I told him I was before the two newbies but he denied this by barking at me in a very rude manner. As my trays eventually went off I told him there was no need to be so grumpy. His eyes were blazing. I would suggest that people like this with absolutely no people or customer service skills are not suitable to be dealing with the public."
security is fast and efficient,9,Pavel Moravec,Czech Republic,22nd December 2017,✅ Trip Verified ," This was the first time I was using this airport and I had a great experience, I was flying from Star Alliance Terminal 2 which the most modern one. Also getting to airport is easy and cheap, because if you go from zone 2 its only £1.50 which is really good and it's fast, really no need for taxi. Airport is really modern and security is fast and efficient. Central departure area is really nice and there are plenty of shops and restaurants and gates are really close so you don't have to sit at the gate until boarding call. I can really recomend this airport and I'm looking forward my next time there."

Only one person at T5 on screening for delayed flight of transit passengers. I missed flight as did many others, referred to overcrowded ticketing counter which then closed, misdirected by staff to open counters, spent 2.5 hrs in queues as never more than 3 people on ticketing in the whole of T5 at any moment. Warning: while most hubs in Europe can transfer you in under 30 minutes T5's automated system will not allow a transfer under 50 minutes. Can't rely on BA to help in a timely manner when it goes wrong. I have personally tried to avoid Heathrow in the past, and will definitely be avoiding in the future."
Terminal-3 looks dated,5,Jonathan Rodden,United Kingdom,4th December 2017,✅ Trip Verified , Arrived at 20.05pm at Terminal 3 on GA86 and had to change to Terminal 5 so as to catch my connecting flight. It is not easy getting the connection between terminals as you need to use a Train. If you have luggage then you have to use the lifts and when the terminal is busy you will have to wait for a lift. Overall the interconnection between terminals is not good. Terminal-3 looks dated and I think it should be ready for an upgrade.
security officers were very courteous,10,Anurag Dave,United States,29th November 2017,✅ Trip Verified ," Transited through London Heathrow T3 and T4 while flying with Virgin Atlantic (T3) and Jet Airways (T4). Unlike LAX, the security officers at Heathrow were very courteous while screening families with children and baby food. We used the children's play area in both terminals. The staff in play area were very welcoming and oriented us to all the available amenities. The play area in Terminal 4 was one of the best that we have been to."
T3 experience was mixed,4,Michael Papalamprou,United Kingdom,22nd November 2017,✅ Trip Verified ," I fly from and to Heathrow dozens of times every year, but this time I used T3 so decided to submit a review. The T3 experience was mixed - departure was reasonably good, short queues at check in and security, very efficient operation. The departure lounge is a disgrace for a terminal primarily operated by long haul airlines. It's literally a big room with shops and eateries around it, full of seating in the middle. Disorganized, overcrowded, with long queues at the coffee shops and less seating than required, when you have a few A380s waiting for departure at any given time."
it was laughable to watch them,2,Derrick Roe,United Kingdom,16th November 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  Terminal 5 security. We are all aware of the ever increasing need for security checks at airports but the security checks at Heathrow T5 are a disgrace. I'm a seasoned traveller but I've never seen anything as haphazard and disorganised as I experienced on 8th November 2017. My hand luggage went through the scanner and was selected for further scrutiny, fair enough, that happens from time to time. However the staff at security then seemed to be at a loss as to what to do. It took ages for someone to actually decide who should actually do the physical check of the bag and how to do that that check, it was laughable to watch them. It was more like watching the Keystone cops than airport security staff. Once they finally go someone to step up to the plate and do the check I had to turn my bag out myself and then everything was taken away for checking. On finding nothing it was then given back to me for repacking with no space to do that. Amateurish. I don't have a problem with additional searches, they are to be expected. I do have a problem with security staff who have no idea how to perform them, it gives me little faith that they could actually find something in the event of there being something there to find. When I returned through Rome airport the following week the Italian security were a model of politeness and efficiency. Note: everything else at Heathrow T5 was excellent, only the unprofessional security staff let the place down."
Heathrow is actually pretty good,8,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,16th November 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  Travelled from T3 with Virgin Atlantic London-Atlanta return Miami-London. T3 is not as nice as T5 but, apart from being a rip-off shopping mall, it's not as bad as people seem to write in the reviews. There are always seats to be found and plenty of eateries should you need to before take off. Bit of a queue at Security outbound but that's pretty much the norm nowadays. Of course queueing time could be cut but the passengers who still don't know - despite all the signs and the fact that this has been going on for years - that liquids of 100 ml or less need to be put in a separate sealed bag etc etc. But mostly it's just something we have to get through before boarding. Wi Fi seemed OK once signed on. On return was in Upper Class so first off of the plane. Did not use Virgin's arrival lounge so quickly through Passport Control (no queue at the electronic gates), baggage arrived super quickly, through customs and picked up the car to be on the M25 in 45 minutes. Compared with a lot of International Airports Heathrow is actually pretty good."
truly a nightmare,3,Richard Clarke,Saudi Arabia,15th November 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  Terminal 5 on a Monday morning is truly a nightmare, traffic was backed down to the M25and took an age to get to the drop of point. Once inside the check in desks nicely spaced out and was easy to check in. Security though is a complete joke, fast track had broken down and was told this is a regular occurrence. Once through you are greeted with an overcrowded terminal with thousands of passengers everywhere. Toilets were completely overwhelmed even in the BA business class lounge you had to queue, top tip is go to the A gates on the lower level as the toilets are hardly used. Everything at the airport is so expensive and even the exchange rates are a rip off if you are changing money. T5 in the morning especially Monday is to be avoided as it's just too overcrowded with hardly any seating to be had and that includes the lounges, a huge need to install more toilets at this terminal is a must! Wifi though was good with a stable connection so it was a plus point. Overall this terminal is in bad need of expanding airside especially."
check in was quick and easy,9,Peter Meikle,United Kingdom,12th November 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Travelled in and out of terminal 3. Departed late afternoon, check in was quick and easy. Very short line at security. Only downside was Heathrow congestion resulting bus gate 24, resulting in delayed departure. Returned at 9am again only problem was Heathrow congestion, plane had to wait nearly half an hour for an airbridge. No line at passport control, bags in hall within 10 minutes of me getting to baggage belt."
there is no smoking room available,1,Jane Moss,United Kingdom,10th November 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  Unlike most international airports there is no smoking room available once past security, as a smoker on a 9 hour flight I find this disgusting that a smoking area has not been provided. Will fly from Gatwick in future and boycott Heathrow until it has seen the error of it ways and provided one."
Expensive over priced food,2,H Cooper,United Kingdom,9th November 2017,✅ Verified Review ,  Cafe Apostrophe should be called Cafe Catastrophe! Long delays at security who were simply so bloomin rude. A smile and a good morning costs nothing. Expensive over priced food. Really bad music blaring out. Poor wifi. And above all toilets were disgusting.
this airport is shocking,1,L Shaw,United Kingdom,8th November 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Apart from the Lufthansa and Singapore Airline Lounges, when it comes to the security check, this airport is shocking. Especially considering how much of the airport taxes actually goes to security, you’d expect people be trained in common courtesy. However most of the security team I encountered over many years travelling in and out of Heathrow are the ""I'm better than thou because the one wearing the uniform"" type, meaning mostly curt and borderline rude, if not obnoxious. I suspect they're even worse when you go through Fast Track - making departing from there a real unpleasant start to the journey 8 or 9 out of 10 times. The worst we've had was a tattoo covered 'gentleman' who just used his body to boss us around without saying a word, even when it was unclear what he wanted and when he finally spoke, he made a snide remark about my companions dreadlocks, who complained directly to Heathrow to no avail, until he twice prompting a non-committals answer but still no apology, making one of Britains' worst airports in terms of customer relations and treatment (worse than London City, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted and Birmingham for sure)."
"Security, rude and obnoxious",3,Allen Hill,Thailand,7th November 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  LHR terminal 3, just another body to be processed not a guest to be taken care of. Check in no problem. Security, rude and obnoxious. I was treated like dirt, the alarm set off as I walked through the detector, shoes and belt already removed. Staff spoke to me rudely and treated me as a potential threat, searched me in a unpolite manner without comment, please or thank you. The terminal is huge with plenty of shops for all tastes, luckily we were able to take shelter in the lounge until the flight was called."
Avoid T5 if at all possible,4,Michael Edwards,United Kingdom,1st November 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Outgoing service was okay for early morning departure to New York JFK. Used BA first class security and Concorde Room so cannot really comment on terminal. Returning was absolutely awful and an embarrassment to be British and have this as our No 1 airport.  Arrived into B Satellite,  and we had to wait for 4 different trains to pass before we could make our way to main Terminal,  to be greeted there by chaos and awful queues for immigration. I like T2 at Heathrow,  but do recommend avoiding T5 if possible -  it is now very badly managed and run."
everything within tolerable limits,7,Anurag Dave,United States,31st October 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  This was my first time traveling from Heathrow Terminal 5. The experience of catching the train towards immigration was a bit confusing. The train was very crowded as well. The immigration line at T5 was very long and took an hour to get through it. Catching the Hoppa Bus to hotel was very convenient. When I arrived at T5 for my flight back home, I found the terminal to be very crowded. I was still able to find a place to sit and watch planes take-off (which was nice!). The boarding gate wasn't assigned until closer to departure time. Once the boarding gate was assigned, we had to catch a train to go there. Despite being a very busy and crowded terminal, everything was within ""tolerable limits""."
Pod Parking is a rip off,3,Graham Fryer,United Kingdom,30th October 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Pod Parking is a rip off. Returned to Heathrow to collect my car and the Pods were not available, so had to catch a bus. Still had to pay the extra cost of Pod parking though. When I queried this I was told of a page which lists the maintenance schedule. Try finding it, its very well hidden. Its not in the T&Cs or on the booking process. Very misleading. Shall not use pods again, will use the cheaper car park with the bus, its the same!"
a complete lack of information,3,H Nelson,United Kingdom,28th October 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  Stressful shambles. The new terminal 2 looks very nice so full points there. We found a complete lack of information as to what to do. We are used to entering an airport. Checking in and job done. Not here. We queued for a while and then found out we needed to self check in. We left the queue and queued for a self check-in station. It didn't recognise my passport but did recognise my ticket number. It printed our boarding passes and we rejoined the queue to drop our bags. Whilst in the queue it became evident that other passengers also had their luggage labels. So we had to leave the queue and rejoin the queue for the self check in again. We started the process again to try and obtain our luggage labels. It wouldn't give these to us but didn't give a reason. It later turned out that the machine won't let you log in twice. We gave up and rejoined the main queue (for the third time). We started to run out of time (now having been at departures for about 45 minutes and still with our luggage). Our flight was called and we were allowed to jump the queue. The systems far easier for them, but much harder for you and there's far more of you than them! If your elderly and behind the times you might as well forget it. Security was slow and we just made our flight with no time to eat and shop etc. Arriving 2 hours early wasn't enough."
navigation is easy,7,Adam Watson,Canada,26th October 2017,❎ Unverified ," This is an very well kept airport. The staff are welcoming and happy. I have never had a problem with baggage loss. Navigation is easy but some walking distances are long. A lot of airlines fly here so its easy for connection, arrival and departure. Security staff are kind and if you are about to miss you flight they will put you in the priority lineup. There are a lot of seat choices in the terminal and it has a very modern interior."
There is no logical explanation,2,Richard Deppe,United States,23rd October 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  Given the number of really negative reviews Heathrow receives, one hopes that you will heed what is written. Ever since 9/11 security at Heathrow has been a nightmare. I shan't go through the interminable waiting, and having to run for a plane more than once. It's just that some of what you subject your passengers to is blatantly stupid. Why, for example, is it necessary to go through a complete screening process when simply making a connection at Heathrow. Are other airports deemed so slack that such is necessary? The scanning agent thought I was trying to smuggle liquids on board. I showed her that they were creams, which she accepted. That did not deter her from going through all my luggage for no apparent reason whatsoever, save the suspicion of liquids, which she had already determined to her satisfaction were not liquids at all. She even did a chemical screening. The couple in front of me had a similar experience. All of their articles of clothing were spread about, again after a suspicion of liquids, again immediately disproved. This is absurdity. I have never experienced anything like what happens at Heathrow at any other airport in the world. There is no logical explanation of this type of screening process, except at the hands of some major control freak. Get rid of him or her and give your clients a break."
staff looked miserable,1,D Sear,United Kingdom,18th October 2017,✅ Verified Review ," I am British and having just arrived from Dallas Fort Worth, I was astonished at the rude attitude towards travellers. While I was in USA I flew several times in the US and all airport staff were helpful and pleasant. At Heathrow T5 it was the total opposite, staff looked miserable, nobody smiled and there was one security chap actually shouting at a traveller in bag inspection before final entry to T5 and they had to suffer this verbal abuse in front of everyone getting screened. The security guy was young 20/30, and was shouting at the traveller to push his tray into XRay machine, he shouted several times at him and even said “push it in, its not rocket science”, I could not believe what was happening. This was approx 7.30am Sunday Oct 15, so everyone at security had travelled in early hours or like myself 15+ hours and through the night. Everyone was tired and then they are subjected to this - a far from a good Welcome to the UK”. Totally disgraceful, Heathrow you have a lot to learn about working with the public. I did see one good security person and he was helpful and understood, but the majority staff did not appear to care. Heathrow is supposed to be the gateway to our country and should show respect and be pleasant to travellers and not treat them like cattle. The other noticeable thing was lack of food outlets on lower floor, we marched around for full length and found a mere handful, while shops were all over place, maybe they were on top level, however after 15 hours we had enough and still another 4 hours before next flight."
surprised how painless the experience was,9,W Banks,United Kingdom,9th October 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  We used Terminal 5 for both departure and arrival. This was the first time in about 10 years we have used Heathrow and having read reports about the airport we were surprised how painless the experience was. We always allow plenty of time to get to the airport and passed though security controls etc. There were plenty of self checks and we were able to print off our boarding passes and go though the security controls and both been regular travellers are aware of the controls and how to avoid delays. Once through there is a good range of shops, cafes and coffee shops. The gates are displayed and also the time it takes to get to the gates from where you are in the terminal. Boarding is quick and painless and there are plenty of seats at the gates. Arrival the aircraft was parked on a B gate which meant a shuttle ride to the baggage reclaim and border controls. The shuttle seemed to take a few minutes to arrive but the trip was only about 2 minutes to the other terminal. The was no real queue and there were only half the desks and epassport machine in use. There was a slight queue but no more than a few minutes. We were out of the terminal within 25 minutes if landing at 2230. Compared to other London airports they seem to have their operation fine tuned."
can't really fault either process,8,Kevin Barrance,United Kingdom,8th October 2017,✅ Verified Review ,  Used Terminal 3 for both departure and arrival and can't really fault either process. Despite being quite busy the security on departure was swift and really the only delays were caused by passengers not removing liquids or other items from their bags despite many instructions to do so. Departure lounge had plenty of seating. Arriving back through the automated passport gates and to the luggage belts was quick and I was out in around 45 minutes from landing which for a full A380 flight is pretty impressive.
rummaged through my meds,2,P Kangas,United States,5th October 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  Arrived 8/9/2017 on the BA red eye from BOS to Heathrow for layover en route to Greece. Had meticulously sorted and packed 8 prescriptions (some topical, some oral, some nasal) into regulation plastic bags with pharmacy labels clearly visible. One was a box containing a large tube of analgesic muscle gel that couldn’t fit into regulation bags, requiring a larger one. Here I was, a mobile and alert, cooperative 65-year-old Anglophile woman with somewhat complex medication needs, carrying legal and medically necessary drugs in her handbag en route to a vacation. Thus I presented a serious risk in the minds of 2 security agents, who in turn rummaged through my meds, taking the topical ones out of pharmacy boxes to inspect and run electronic wands over for 20 minutes, seeking bomb-making materials, while advising me that all 8 meds must fit into one regulation plastic bag—that I could throw away pharmacy boxes so they’d all fit. This seemed an episode out of Monty Python’s “You Can’t Win” game. I refused as their suggestion would defy the laws of physics, damage some containers, be confusing as some meds had to be used in certain combinations, and eliminate prescription labels containing dosage directions attached to boxes. How, I asked, would I explain to other agents, upon my return from Greece via Heathrow, such medications with no labels to prove their contents? The agents agreed with this argument but managed to lose one prescription bottle entirely and jumble everything in their zeal to protect the UK against American grandmothers and music teachers. My husband, who’d not been to England before, swore never to go there again after the incident. "
The staff really don't care,3,N Edwards,Cyprus,3rd October 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  The staff clearly don't care that people are actually in a hurry to get to their planes. The automatic systems at Heathrow work like a charm, you go through the process in no second. However every time there are human beings involved everything gets 100 times slower. The staff really don't care, they take so much time to do trivial actions without even having the remote EQ to understand that they should at least pretend that they are fast. Unacceptable!"
a good departure,8,Paul Ginnifer,United Kingdom,24th September 2017,❎ Unverified , Travelled out of Terminal 3. Check in at Virgin desk was very good and I was quickly through security within about 5 minutes. We were called to the aircraft on time and boarded without and hassle. It was a good departure. Only negative comment is the distance to the gate from the main terminal building.
worst security screening ever,3,S Parker,France,23rd September 2017,✅ Verified Review ," Worst security screening ever, slow and lazy staff, not enough lanes open. Took 30 minutes to go through, almost missed my plane. They better hire people and hire more motivated people because for me it was the last time I go thru this London airport. Better Gatwick and Luton by far"
Customer service is non-existent,1,W Dawson,United Kingdom,15th September 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  By far one of the worst airports to depart from and arrive at in the world. The airport security staff are most definitely the rudest, the most arrogant and without doubt the most incompetent set of individuals one could possibly encounter in any customer services business anywhere in the world. I truly feel sorry for tourists entering England for the first time and having to encounter the human zoo otherwise known as Heathrow airport. The electronic passport gates were not all working but this was not mentioned by the one member of staff whose grasp of the English language was sub-standard, people were queuing up in lanes where the machines were out of order leading to a build up of irate travel weary passengers. Customer service is non-existent in Heathrow airport, the security is undoubtedly the worst ever and that goes for all the UK airports!"
a really easy experience overall,8,John Barry,United Kingdom,9th September 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  T5. Dropped the car at meet and greet. Down one floor, across bridge, straight up to bag drop off, quick service there. Through security in quick time, staff all ok. Shopped in three different places and still in lounge in 50 mins from drawing up in car. Can't be bad. Departure from gate practically at bottom of stairs so all really easy. All boarded on time but then the dreaded Heathrow over crowding of slots. Still a really easy experience overall. When T5 works, it really works well we have found. Coming back from Zante shows how good it is."
All in all a bad experience,1,M Thomas,Switzerland,9th September 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Security staff at Terminal 5 were condescending and rude, likewise the staff at the restaurant. For transit passengers this may be the first or only contact they have with a British person, gives a bad impression of the airport and of Britain. Restaurant had water dripping from the ceiling from an unrepaired air con unit and their only card reader was not working. Gate announcement was late resulting in a rush to building 'C' where the escalator was not working and we had to queue for the lift. All in all a bad experience, I probably won't use this terminal again which is a pity for British Airways who were otherwise good.

he received no help at all,1,Maureen Barnett,United Kingdom,30th August 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  My brother who has terminal cancer recently flew to and from Canada, via Heathrow airport, to visit his grandchildren. Due to his illness he is unable to carry luggage so had requested assistance on both journeys. Unbelievably he received no help at all. On his return he had to descend 3 flights of stairs. Thankfully a very kind passenger gave him assistance. Your services absolutely stink Heathrow."
security took less than 5 minutes to get through,9,O Thompson,United Kingdom,30th August 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Terminal 5. Minimal queue at bag drop and security took less than 5 minutes to get through, despite being the Friday morning of the bank holiday weekend. The departure area was very busy, as always, but we found a seat without a problem. Our flight departed from the A gates so no need to take the transit, although the waiting areas for these gates do feel cramped. Boarding was orderly. When we returned on bank holiday Monday there was no queue at all for the EU passport gates and our suitcases arrived within 10 minutes. I have to say, I have never had a bad experience at Terminal 5 and use it around 5 times per year. This this may not be representative of the rest of Heathrow, but I always find it a very efficient and slick experience especially compared to the other London airports."
the terminal is just beautiful,9,A Ridley,United Kingdom,30th August 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  So I haven't flown from T5 before and what can I say, I wish all airport terminals were the same. The personable experience from the lady at security when I said I was a nervous flyer, she was very friendly and reassuring, also sparked up a conversation with me about my travels, it really helped me calm down. So from security I went to itsu, and the food was amazing and for an airport so reasonably priced for what I got. Also, I have to say the terminal is just beautiful, really well designed and laid out, I usually struggle to find gates but as they were all pretty much in one place it made it so user friendly. Definitely flying from here again."
my quickest and smoothest airport experience,9,C Bollani,United Kingdom,25th August 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  
Leaving and arriving at Heathrow Terminal 5 have been my quickest and smoothest airport experiences for an airport of that size. The arrival in particular was very fast as there was hardly any queue at all at the automated passport control (at rush hour!) and our luggage was on the collection belt as soon as we arrived. On the way out I was astonished by the range of shops after passing security and by how clean the place was despite the number of people passing through it. I also liked the free water fountains for refilling bottles. The only improvement I would suggest would be to make it clearer how long it takes to get to the departure gate, as it was quite long-winded for us due to having to take an underground train and several escalators and conveyor belts.
"
he was treated with full consideration,7,Emma Ketley,Australia,25th August 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  We understand Heathrow to be the busiest airport for passenger traffic in Europe and it certainly seems like it. Considering the numbers that Heathrow serves, we would like to compliment the ground staff and the security staff for their respectfulness and good humour. My father has poor health and a pacemaker. On both our outward and return journeys, my father was called for further screening. At these times, he demonstrated anxiety at being separated from his wife or those who usually assist him. However, as a family we all recognised that he was treated with full consideration, patience and both times he left the screen process laughing with the good humour of your staff. Thank you - you made a potentially distressing security check comfortable and efficient. Besides this, we would not recommend this airport due to its sheer busyness and passenger numbers!"
terminal needs a colourful revamp though,4,Francois Koenig,South Africa,25th August 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Arrival BA054 / 04 AUG 17 from JNB after fantastic BA inflight service. I thought I had arrived at a massive General Hospital! Stark, grey, lacking any form of colour or greenery and utterly confusing. Up and down multiple escalators, catch a 20 sec train ride, super long arrival queues (although well manned and directed), unfriendly Immigration (maybe all countries should send their officials on Customer Services training?). Another long walk to baggage carousel. Departure BA055 / 13 AUG 17 to JNB. BA Fast drop queues very long although well directed with friendly check-in staff manning many counters. Security was a drag- slow and unfriendly. Duty Free area was OK and had some colour to it Wifi connection was bad. BA inflight service very good on this flight - their home base terminal needs a colourful revamp though."
sat on the apron for an hour,5,Paul Ginnifer,United Kingdom,25th July 2017,❎ Unverified ,"  This review of terminal 5 can be broken down into 2 sections. Departure which was very smooth with very little delay at either boarding card check or through security. There were 5 of us, we all sailed through in 15 minutes. We found a seat at a restaurant and had a reasonable meal and a few drinks. We were called to gate 10 and were then ferried to our Qatar Airways plane. Should have been BA but changed due to the strike. A good experience. On return this is with BA we took off on time and were given a 2 hour flight time. We then circled the Thames estuary for 35 minutes Heathrow traffic was the culprit. When we eventually landed we then sat on the apron for an hour as there weren't any free gates apparently because of thunder storms. When we did get a gate we made our way to immigration just in time to see all the e reader get switched off, there were originally 5 or 6 working but they suddenly all turned red. When we went to baggage a sign was flashing saying 45 minute wait for luggage, thankfully we only had hand luggage. We went to the car, parked in the short time car park, where although we had pre paid the machine said we needed to pay £275 to leave the car park. This however was quickly resolved. A really rubbish experience. Completely opposite to departure."
very expensive shops,1,Sherry Gilson,United States,20th July 2017,❎ Unverified , I hate London Heathrow airport. Arrived very early in the morning as you usually do when traveling from the US to UK. Had a very long way to walk from terminal 5 to other terminals after my overnight flight. Long walk to bathroom (found only one) through very expensive shops. Few choices for food. Ate at Eat - only inexpensive place for breakfast with so many flights coming in. Very difficult to find a place to sit with luggage. Did have good pasteries and coffee. Much prefer Gatwick.
lots of shops and facilities,9,Attila Toth,United Kingdom,13th July 2017,❎ Unverified , London Heathrow Terminal 2 is nice and tidy. Outside of it you have a limited view to the runways. Main hall is spacious. The transit zone is situated on two floors and offers lots of shops and facilities. Lots of seating areas but phone charging sockets are not working at the seats. There is however a dedicated phone charging station. There are plenty of flight information screens around and a huge windowed wall opposite side of entering the building.
a really lovely way to start a holiday,9,C Button,United Kingdom,21st June 2017,❎ Unverified , I've just dropped my daughter at London Heathrow Terminal 2 flying to Australia with Thai Airways. I'm really impressed with the cleanliness and smooth running of the airport and the number and helpfulness of airport staff. It's a really lovely way to start a holiday.
better than some other airports,9,W Reader,United Kingdom,5th June 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Nice lounge with direct view of plane, small choice of food, hot and cold both Malaysian and English. Good Wi-Fi, seats could be a little more comfortable but fine and better than some other airports. Good selection of drinks, toilets are always clean and showers a very clean."
no acknowledgement of our existence,2,K Simpson,Gibraltar,31st May 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Due to the BA computer failure our flight was directed to a vacant parking spot instead of the usual drop off. I was fine with this, as I understand that steps had to be taken due to resolution methods used. What I was not fine with was the so called ""customer ambassadors"" (dressed in purple) gossiping behind our back, assuming that we did not speak and / or understand English. When we arrived, we were directed to an entry point. We then had to bang on a door, because two (2) ""Customer ambassadors"", just opposite the door, blatantly ignored us. All this took place whilst another customer ambassadors kept telling us that this was the only way in. Finally, they let us in. No apology and no acknowledgement of our existence, their faces drawn into a grimace, as though we had trampled on their consecrated tea break. We finally found our way by the use of signs and arrived at a closed door. A man was on the other end, telling us to wait. We wait and wait and wait whilst he has a general laugh with his colleagues on the other side. Finally he uses the card (around his neck) to open the door. None of this actually dampened my mood until we came across two women. To say that they were rude would be an understatement. After all the inconvenience we had already experienced, they decided that their best approached would be to demand our boarding pass in a tone one would use on a convicted criminal. Despite their disgraceful behavior, the request made sense. I offered my passport, with the boarding pass included. Being South African, I’m generally asked for everything. I thought I would spare us all the impending interrogation. To my surprise, not only does she sigh in frustration, but the moment we turn our backs, she looks at her colleagues and starts complaining. ""Why didn’t they just give me their boarding pass"", to which her colleague responds ""Maybe they don’t speak English"". My truthful feedback would be that a few our ambassadors should receive refresher training. If you plan on flaunting a title of customer ambassadors, you should make sure that you are worth of the title. The BA error must have been extremely frustrating for them, but that, by no means, excused their outright disrespect and poor service.

anywhere but Heathrow,1,Wayne Gobert,Australia,21st May 2017,unverified,"Second time arriving at London Heathrow and 1 hour in the Border line (both times). An absolute disgrace. Plenty of empty immigration desks but no staff. The EU passport side was empty but ""the rest of the world "" spiralled out through lane after lane of traffic tape. As for the ""purple people "" Heathrow staff who seem to do nothing but scowl - what do they actually do? Once again by the time we got through our luggage had been taken off the luggage belt and stored by someone. If you can avoid this airport go anywhere but Heathrow."
slowed the entire process,1,D Mitchell,United States,13th May 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  The archaic and entirely idiotic ""1 bag"" of liquids only slowed the entire process of security to a crawl. I watched staff running around asking for certain timed flights to cut to the front and entire families desperate to put travel size bottles (that are allowed in every other airport) into 1 tiny bag per person. When I asked why they had this rule I was told ""it's your fault for not looking at the website of the airport your connecting flight was routes through"". Customer service at this airport is garbage and I will never fly through this airport again, regardless of the cost."
Customer Service is dead,2,C Allen,United States,8th May 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Customer Service is dead at Heathrow Airport: I had an hour to make my connection at Heathrow this morning. I did not have to change terminals, both my incoming and outbound flights were in terminal 5 and still I could not make it to the gate on time. I entered the ""Fast Track"" lane. Within 2 minutes I got moved, with others, to anther lane (non-fast track). As we are standing in line and others were complaining about the line not moving at all, I overhead the security staff member say to one of the traveling public, ""Fast Track does not mean you move fast"" - his words not mine! Finally, I got my bags on the belt for X-ray screening but my bag got pulled out for an extra security check and this is where the experience of abrupt, rude, uncaring security staff became most obvious. With a line of bags to be screened, I told the security manager 3 times I was going to miss my flight. ""No you will not Sir""! she insisted each time. As I ran to the gate, the bus was pulling away. BA attendants at the gate tried to stop the bus but were unsuccessful, but, they had no radios connecting them to the driver or anyone who could help. A colleague of mine made the flight was was to be on and 20 minutes after the bus pulled away the plane doors closed. I paid for a Business class seat and what did I get for it? The middle finger from Heathrow Airport. Airport management at Heathrow and around the world need to wake up and be reminded that we are ""customers"" not something you can take your own frustrations out on. We are paying your wages and it would be refreshing to see a little Customer Care. PS. The BA staff at the re-booking counter were very professional and did their best."
appears to be on an all or nothing basis,6,J Richards,United Kingdom,3rd May 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  This was my first time flying out of and back into the new Terminal two at Heathrow airport. Whilst I try not to believe the hype around the opening of new termini these days, such is the disappointment one usually experiences, I couldn't help but let my expectations rise just a little. Drop-off and check-in was fine. My travelling companion and I, both of us disabled, were directed away from the kiosks to a manned counter. We were offered assistance making our way to the gate but turned it down on the basis that we are both able to walk and that in any case we wanted to have a bite to eat ahead of departure. We were told however to be at the gate at least an hour before the flight in order to be boarded ahead of the rush of other passengers. At security it was frustrating to have to walk back and forth through the interminable queueing system despite the absence of a queue. One would have expected, on seeing two disabled passengers, that staff would direct us to a more straightforward route. The security process itself however was painless, staff were polite and friendly, and it was all done and dusted pretty quickly. On entering the departure lounge however, on checking monitors for our gate number, we discovered that the number would not be provided until 70 minutes before the flight, giving us just 10 minutes to get there. We enquired at the information desk as to whether they had any early information on the likely gate, and were told that we would have to find an airline desk downstairs, wasting yet more time. Instead, we wolfed down a passable dinner at the closest restaurant we could find before checking the screens again. One expects the walk to One's departure gate to be long at Heathrow. What was a surprise at such a new terminal however, was finding that the entire route to the satellite building is undertaken with moving walkways rather than any kind of transit system, such as at terminal five, Stanstead, and numerous other airports. I will confess that the escalator trip down to the subway is impressive in its scale, but a faster means of transport involving less walking would have been a more inclusive approach for all passengers. The remainder of our departure run smoothly, and we were on our way to Seoul almost dead on time. The most frustrating thing about our departure experience however was that airport assistance appears to be on an all or nothing basis. Either one waits to be ferried through the terminal like a lump of luggage, without the opportunity to eat or shop, or one makes one's own way but without any help in the shape of shortened cues, timely information or intra terminal transport. Walking distances aside, our experience on return to terminal two, two weeks later, was reasonably positive. We were ushered to the special assistance passport counter, and were through in a matter of minutes. By the time we reached baggage reclaim our bags were not only there, but had been stacked next to the carousel. The only irritation was chasing our tails around the shortstay car park to find the lane where our Uber driver could collect us. Whilst I realise that Uber is just one of many private hire operators it would be good if airport authorities could recognise the nature and popularity of this service, and provide a more accessible means of being collected. So, all in all, there was nothing terrible about our overall experience."
almost 3 hours from landing to leaving the airport,1,T Lee,Taiwan,30th April 2017,✅ Verified Review ," Arrived at Heathrow Airport T2 just before 8PM, and the queues at non EU Immigration Control were unbelievably long. It took me an hour just to be able to see the front of the queue and the Immigration Control desks, only 2 were open, and it took me another hour to reach the immigration control desk, it was then I released that there were 4 UK Board control Agency officers standing there chatting to each other, oblivious to the queues right in front of them. 2.5 hours later, I managed to pass the immigration control, but by then, all the luggage had been removed from the carousel they were assigned to as new flights arrived. I managed to find my luggage amongst a mountain of luggage next to carousel 8. So, it took me almost 3 hours from landing to leaving the airport, and I was the lucky one, as I was one of the first to leave the aircraft, passengers from the same flight were still queueing when I went throughout the immigration control. The driver who came to pick me up told me this is not a one off but a daily occurrence. I think I will fly to Amsterdam next time and take a connecting flight into Leeds (my final destination), a small regional airport but seems to have more immigration officers (the last time I arrived there, there were 4 in total and I got through within minutes)."
couldn't have been more impressed,10,Philip Williams,Thailand,28th April 2017,unverified,"What a wonderful surprise! I hadn't used London Heathrow for 20 years (preferring to use my hometown airport Birmingham) but I couldn't have been more impressed. The immigration officers were chatty and friendly. There were plenty of good eating options and far cheaper than I expected of a London Airport. More than adequate seating areas. There's a great selection of hotels for an overnight stay, served by the excellent Hoppa shuttle service. Bus stations and bays are well sign-posted and easy to find. The security check was a breeze, even providing a nice area to pack your belongings after your stuff has gone through the scanner. Well done Heathrow! You make international travel that little bit more bearable."
a thoroughly unpleasant experience,2,G Irving,New Zealand,26th April 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  This was a thoroughly unpleasant experience. Arrived early morning via BA into terminal five, no gates available so we were bussed into the building. From there we had a long walk to yet another bus to take us to terminal three - the second bus stop was literally metres away from the original bus stop. There were few actual seats on each bus, so standing was the only option. Once in terminal three signage was pitiful, and the toilets limited - more walking, no moving travelators, no toilets once at the gate. Security screening - the most grumpy lot that I encountered during eight flights. All in all very poor, in future I will travel via Amsterdam."
I've been in the passport line for 1 hour,1,A Victor,United Kingdom,26th April 2017,✅ Verified Review ," It's just insane. I've been in the line for all other passports at London Heathrow Airport for about 1 hour now, and we almost haven't moved. There are hundreds of people and only 3 passport control officers with about 10 available cabins. Is it really that difficult to predict the number of people arriving to the airport knowing the frequency and capacity of planes? It's just disrespectful to all the people citizens coming back to London where they pay huge taxes, and to all the tourists who come here to spend money"
security staff stood watching proceedings,7,Paul Ginnifer,United Kingdom,25th April 2017,unverified,"Got To terminal 2 and booked in with EVA Air within 5 minutes. Got pulled by security to have my hand luggage searched, apparently my earphones blocked my DVD player. Why there was only one checker is a mystery. Although 3 security staff were stood watching proceedings. Obviously management, come on role your sleeves up and help. I then had a 15 to 20 minute slog to the 'B' gates. Once in the Air Canada lounge I could relax. Flight got called and left on time. On return got to immigration quickly and through the 'E' Gate quickly. The ordinary check was manic blocked way back. Picked up luggage quckly and got to parking bus pick up in good time. Good experiance coming back marginally better than going."
immigration staff service is inconsistent,6,S Douglas,Indonesia,23rd April 2017,✅ Verified Review ," Foreign (non-UK, non-EU) traveler here. The immigration staff service at London Heathrow Airport is inconsistent. Sometimes they are really awful and being rude, but other times they are pretty professional and know what they are doing. UK Border Force have to be more friendly as they are the first image of British people that tourist will see. Immigration queue is usually long and take so much time. Queue on security when flying out is horrible. If a guy on front of you is caught on secondary check for bringing in a water bottle, takes so much time. If you caught in a secondary check, it takes ages for them to get you because usually there are lots of people getting secondary checks. Ground handling is really good. The immigration queue is already long enough that your bag would already be there. Tried some F&B;, they are your standard London food and nothing really special. The seating arrangement before the checkin counter is really bad as there are no seats at all, but there are lots of seating, which are comfortable, after you clear security checkpoint. Shopping is too high end. Not a really wonderful airport, but better than others."
Terminal 3 was faultless,9,W Jenkins,United Kingdom,1st April 2017,✅ Verified Review ," As a UK traveller getting through Heathrow Terminal 3 was faultless. There was quite a long walk to immigration from the gate but, even at 7.30am when a number of planes were landing, I was through immigration in about three minutes. The bags then arrived at the same time I did in the hall and I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of landing. Absolutely brilliant. It would be interesting to know how passengers from the US fared - do they experience waits of 2 hours plus as I always seem to do when landing n the US?"
"spacious, lots of light",9,M Sheikh,Canada,30th March 2017,unverified,"This review is specific to London Heathrow Terminal 2. We transited through one our way back to Canada. No real issues in regards to queues, relatively smooth, obviously some heightened security with everything going on in the world. Once through all the security checks, we took the bus from Terminal 4 to Terminal 2, the bus comes every 10 minutes so did not have to wait too long. After a lot of walking, which is not too bad since they have the moving floor belts, we got to Terminal 2. I must say this is one of the best looking terminals I have seen in quite some time. Spacious, lots of light, and lots to do. First of all, nice to see that Heathrow offers free wi-fi now. Terminal 2 is two stories, lots of seating areas, lots of shopping and a few coffee shops with some restaurants mixed in. There are a few private lounges as well, showers, an area that offers beds to sleep on if you have a long wait. I had a 6 hour lay over and I was able to pass time relatively easily. Definitely a nice change after having gone through Jeddah. Terminal 2 has huge windows so you can look out onto the tarmac and watch flights take off. Highly recommend this terminal."
long winding queues,2,E Moore,United Kingdom,9th March 2017,unverified,Modern look but badly planned with long walks up and down escalators to arrivals. UK Border a most unpleasant and unwelcoming vision. Long winding queues of shuffling tired passengers to a line of machines half of which were not operating. Being herded all the time. Machines slow and lady in front entered passport three times before finally rejected. Luggage delivery seemed ok but allowing for time lost getting there not fast.
queues were long and disorganised,1,O Taylor,Saudi Arabia,8th March 2017,✅ Verified Review ,  Queues were long and disorganised. Had to wait over half an hour to use the E gates (EU passports with chip) as some gates kept on stopping to function. When one was available I found it it could not read my passport. Would have been quicker in the Standard queue or even better in the Non EU line. Complete and utter joke of an airport.
was out of the airport within 25 minutes,8,W Johnson,United Kingdom,3rd March 2017,✅ Verified Review ,  Arrived on a flight from USA at about 8.30am and there was no queue at all in the EU Immigration area. My bag arrived promptly too and I was out of the airport within 25 minutes of leaving the plane. Could not have been better. I suspect I was lucky but can only say what I found.
staff were polite and efficient,8,T Robinson,United Kingdom,2nd March 2017,✅ Verified Review ,  I travelled from Heathrow Terminal 3 at the end of February. Terminal was very clean. No check in queue. Hardly any queue at security and staff were polite and efficient. Terminal 3 departures is not great as the selection of shops is average and numerous high end shops. More high street shops would be great. Overall a pleasant experience.
"clean, efficient and has plenty of good choices",8,B Johnson,United Kingdom,22nd February 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  I still find it strange this airport wins an award for shopping. For the normal commuter or traveller it only has high brand companies in T2 and T5 which are the most up to date terminals. Otherwise it is clean, efficient and has plenty of good choices. Can't complain only really airports in the Middle East can rival."
I have waited over an hour and a half at passport control,2,Nat Smith,United Kingdom,20th February 2017,unverified,How many people does it take to stamp a passport? Apparently no one. Because we waited so long we thought we would never get back into the country. I am here on a visa and I understand that you take passport control very seriously and I tried to be patient. However. As an airport you know when the flights come in therefore should be staffed enough to make it a nice quick experience for the people. If people don't think the British are grumpy they do now. This has happened twice in the last month I have waited over an hour and a half at passport control with 1-2 lanes open. For everyone's sanity please manage your staff better because they are just doing there job and don't deserve to be yelled at by the many people in the line!
What a bad impression it must give visitors to the UK,2,Katherine Wilson,United Kingdom,19th February 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Obviously in this day and age we expect to have to remove laptops, have liquids checked etc. but I don't understand why Heathrow staff are always so rude about it. They have an arrogant sneer about them if you have not been able to read their minds. It seems because they now have to be more careful about security, politeness no longer matters. I have experienced this numerous times at Heathrow. You don't get this at other airports. Today it was at Terminal 4. What a bad impression it must give visitors to the UK."
on the whole a good experience,8,Paul Ginnifer,United Kingdom,16th February 2017,unverified,My first time from terminal 5. I have heard so many mixed reviews. Outward everything went really well and very quickly. From being dropped off by hotel bus until through into departure took about 20 to 25 minuted. This included not knowing the airport security and bag drop. Had nice breackfast and boarded plane hassle free. Return journey exactly the same hassle free until it came to collecting luggage and that took about 40 minutes. It would have been better if there had been seats to sit on. But on the whole a good experience and I would use again.
Easy check-in and quick security,9,John Bradley,United Kingdom,15th February 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  I have been critical of Heathrow airport in the past but the last half a dozen experiences (Terminals 2 / 3 / 4 over the last 2-months) have been excellent. Easy check-in and quick security, excellent shopping and dining options and the main improvement has been arrivals. Even with immigration, luggage to collect and using off-site car parks, I have been in my car ready to leave 30 to 40-minutes after landing - excellent considering the size of the airport. I know there is a degree of luck with this, but the fact this has been so consistent recently, is what impresses me."
nice shops and facilities,8,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,4th February 2017,unverified,"Flew Air New Zealand from London Heathrow Terminal 2 to Los Angeles. Check in really good, fast track security good, security staff were even forgiving when I forgot to empty my pockets. Nice shops and facilities. Only disappointment was the Singapore Airlines lounge used by Air New Zealand which was tired, worn out fittings and poor choice of indifferent food - very disappointing."
basic manners from the security staff would go a long way,3,F Edmonds,United Kingdom,17th January 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  The security staff here are both very rude and inefficient. We are customers of the airport, not prisoners here against our own free will. Some basic manners from the security staff would go a long way. They are not representing just the airport but also our country as a whole. Barking orders at people but then not explaining what is going on is not acceptable, nor is it likely to help people progress through security quickly. I understand that they have an important job to do, however this is true in any airport. In most European and American airports the staff are both helpful and polite. Understandably this also tends to mean their lines move faster."
prepare for a delay up to one hour,3,Pieter Boone,Netherlands,13th January 2017,unverified,"BA's extensive route network make it an attractive airline to use to get to places. I am using them a lot. This review focuses on a situation that has been going on for years at T5 and it's unacceptable. This time I arrived from MIA at T3 took the airside but to BA's T5. There you are led through the rather efficient stages where someone confirms your connection then sends you up the stairs to go through security again. Getting to the conveyor belt is just a matter of waiting for your turn, it does move. The problem starts when your luggage will not come out of the X-ray machine directly to you, but is rerouted to endure secondary inspection. Luckily mine got straight through but I witnessed what I have seen time and time again. A dozen or more bags waiting to be inspected, very anxious passengers under a lot of time pressure and one security staff member that seems to take an extreme amount of time per bag to investigate, unpack, re-screen, repack etc. Just so painful to watch. These security staff members work unsupervised and there is not a thing you can do to express urgency, ask for sympathy or engage in anyway without delaying the process even more. It's is shameless power play with people under pressure, people that have been traveling for hours, may not feel comfortable, people whose bags come from a 'clean & cleared' situation (because they came directly from a plane and had been previously scanned). It is totally unacceptable and there is nothing you can do. My advice is to unpack anything that might raise concerns: batteries, small bottles, wires, computers, phone etc etc. put that all in separate bins. When you are about to start unpacking, peek over the X-ray to see if there is a difference taking the left or right scanning machine, the left may be empty for secondary checks while the right is all backed up. If you do end up for secondary checks, prepare for a delay up to one hour."
mostly communication problems,2,J Naumiec,United States,12th January 2017,unverified,"Arrived to London Heathrow from Amsterdam on a flight to connect to another flight to Chicago. Flight from Amsterdam was late which left just enough time to catch my connecting flight. Signs directing passengers to connecting flights were not very clear. The rep was standing at the bottom of an escalator was a joke as there were 3 different reps from 3 different airlines. No way to tell which rep was from which airline. The instructions I was given weren't clear. As I raced to the gate, I checked the departure list and saw my flight was on time. Stopped by a customer service stand and asked them to contact the gate as I would be late in arriving. They informed me the flight was delayed for 30 minutes. I got to my gate as they were boarding. That experience could have been improved by better signs, clearer directions from BA staff, Airline reps having a proper place to address passengers . Updated flight information. Mostly a communication problem. Never had a chance to experience any amenities at Heathrow. I will do my utmost to avoid Heathrow in the future."
investments in the various terminals have paid off,7,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,9th January 2017,unverified,"Flew from LHR to Sao Paulo. No check in queue. No security queue. Flew through in a breeze. Had a meal in one of the lovely eateries in T3. My only grumble is the lack of normal high street shops, ie with things people can afford. It is all a bit 'high end'. Overall, very good though. The investments in the various terminals have paid off!"
so impressed by Heathrow,8,V Andrews,United Kingdom,9th January 2017,✅ Verified Review ," After a horrendous experience at the chaotic and overcrowded Toronto Pearson airport, I was so impressed by Heathrow that I thought I would say a few words in its favour. People tend to submit reviews when they are not happy with services and had I not had such a bad experience at the previous airport I probably would not have thought of writing positively about this one. After a very difficult 17 hour journey it was a pleasant relief to find getting through at Heathrow was such a breeze. After landing at Heathrow I found clean and spacious washroom facilities before reaching immigration. There were drinking fountains I could use to fill up my water bottle. I then got through immigration very quickly using, for the first time, the self scan passport booths. There was a helpful member of staff there to assist which was useful as I put mine in the wrong way round the first couple of times. Then my baggage came off very quickly and the baggage reclaim area was clean and orderly and there were plenty of trolleys. Signage was good and I easily got to the underground where I picked up a Piccadilly line train almost immediately. The whole process from disembarkation to stepping onto the train was about 45 minutes."
avoid terminal 3 if possible,2,Sue Morley,United Kingdom,8th January 2017,unverified,"London Heathrow terminal 3 with it's endless walking to departures, utterly appalling check in procedures is an embarrassment to the UK and international travel. We took our son to get his AA flight to Raleigh Durham this morning. Queues everywhere. The self check machines did not all work. We kept being sent to a different queue and different desk. I asked for advice from a member of staff whose badge stated he was there to help, he actually shrugged and said ""well what do you want me to do?"" Almost beyond belief. It took 90 minutes to check in which is dreadful. It was stressful, the staff were surly and rude, people were being treated with disdain. I will never, ever spend my money with American Airlines again. I would advise anyone to avoid terminal 3 if possible."
a real nightmare,6,Edgar Lopez,United States,4th January 2017,unverified,"If you can, please avoid London Heathrow airport. I had a layover of 2hrs and 20 minutes and I almost lost my flight to Dallas. I had to walk through endless corridors, then take a slow bus to reach the next terminal, and then at terminal 3 there where only 3 staff helping a queue of 60 people at the American Airlines counters. I needed to wait for boarding passes for me an my family. We waited for about 45 minutes to do this. Then another security inspection, and finally walk of half a mile to reach gate 42. I would rather connect in any other European airport, Heathrow is a real nightmare."
rude employees,1,N Andrews,United Kingdom,4th January 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  Rude employees at check in, security and even the lounges (incl. Concorde room!), terminal transfers are too long and on dirty busses and security denies you boarding if your flight is scheduled to depart even one second short of 35 min later regardless if you have checked a bag or not. BA has no standby so you will be forced to pay £300+ to take the next flight. If you decide to fly another airline they threaten to cancel your return ticket. The airport hotels are too far with unreliable transportation to the terminals, esp. in the early mornings (busses take forever, no cabs to be found and Uber takes 15 min to pick you up). Never connect here, never fly BA and hopefully this will teach them not to take customers for granted. 
"
waited more than one and a half hours,1,K Peters,Australia,4th January 2017,✅ Verified Review ,"  On our arrival, only few tables for many hundreds of visitors for writing the custom forms at the immigration so many sat on floor to complete their customer forms. We waited more than one and a half hours in the long long queue. I wondered why the immigration officer asked so many unrelated questions to our trip such as asked about my work scope, how long I have worked for the company, what working hours and asked my son what course he is studying, how many years to go etc.. No wonder why we had to wait for more than one and a half hours in the long long queues. On our departure, we waited more than 45 minutes in the queue for the claim VAT. They worked very slow."
this has really been a horrible experience,1,Anthony Blackburn,United Kingdom,3rd January 2017,unverified,"My complaint is about staff attitude. We were flying out of Heathrow Terminal 5 on the 17 December. The airport had severe problems with fog. We could not find a member of staff who could be helpful. One member of staff just said, if I was you I would come back tomorrow, not what you want to be told when you have missed your plane (after sitting on a plane at Newcastle for 5 hours) and are trying to find out what is happening. I have always found Heathrow to be quite good but this has really been a horrible experience. The return journey was a little bit better but not by much."
state of the art,10,Gilberto Sing,United Kingdom,2nd January 2017,✅ Verified Review ," London Heathrow as always provided excellent service during the customs process procedure coming from LAX, disembarked in good time, no delays, UK customs were really professional. The terminal cleanliness fine, lots of signs to go through customs and for baggage claim, Terminal 5 is a state of the art airport terminal with all the services in it."
just another gilded souk,2,C Maylin,United Kingdom,28th December 2016,unverified,"London Heathrow airport is nice and clean. However the duty free area is just another gilded souk. Every time that you try and stop to have a look at something, an aggressive sales shark will pounce upon you. I was stopped 11 times. Should you have the misfortune of having to buy something, you are harassed into buying other products. It's an absolute headache and a very unpleasant experience. They lost money from me. Staff are not even qualified in their concessions. Clearly everyone is on targets and minimum wage. There does not need to be customer service as it's a captive non repeat business audience. I expect this in the middle and far east but not in UK. It's horrible. Just don't bother and buy at your destination."
new design of terminal is atrocious,1,Frank Rispin,Ethiopia,28th December 2016,unverified,"London Heathrow Terminal 2. Considering it is a very new the design of this terminal is atrocious. Escalators, up down up down, too many too long corridors Lifts after you emerge from all the walking are too few, too small, waiting area too windy and cold. 3 times the automatic passport machines are not working. This time as ever we were passed thru a manual queue. Not enough staff on. Two lots in front of me were problem cases. We waited and waited. Fortunately a wise observant staff member saw our predicament and moved us in front of a queue. Finally the lifts to the coach station, old inadequate, unsuitable."
an efficient way of arriving to London,8,Imtiaz Quwailid,United Kingdom,27th December 2016,✅ Verified Review ," Weekend trip to Edinburgh with British Airways meant flying from, and returning to London Heathrow Terminal 5. This is our most used route, normally travelled at least once a year. I had checked in online to minimise queuing at the terminal, and on this instance, had the boarding passes sent to our smartphones. Our flight, BA1454 was scheduled to depart at 17:30. We entered the terminal at 15:00, went directly to the Bag Drop (no queue at the multiple desks), then onto Security. Given the time of day (mid-afternoon on a Friday) the queues were short and we were Airside at 15:10. 10 minutes to drop off bags and get through security is near excellent. The departure lounge was crowded, but we made our way to the Two Rivers pub/restaurant. As it's a Wetherspoons, the prices are low and quality/selection of food and drink is very good. The only premium lounge at T5 is the BA lounge (as Blue members we aren't allowed in), but the Wetherspoons is the best alternative. After a quick bite, we alternate visiting the shops until our flight is called. As the gate is right by the pub, we wait until just before boarding to join the queue. Our return to Terminal 5 was equally quick this time. We deplaned at 16:59, walked over to Baggage Claim and had to wait a few minutes for the bags to start arriving on the carousel. There were only two carousels in this area (I am guessing there are other carousels for the international flights that arrive at the B and C gates). We collected our luggage and exited into the public area of the terminal at 17:20. All things considered, Terminal 5 is an efficient way of exiting or arriving to London. I think in this case we were fortunate with our flight times - in particular I have never seen such a short queue at Security. It is quite crowded and noisy in Departures however. There are many high-end stores, but none seem to be really busy. Staple airport favourites such as Boots, WH Smith and World Duty Free attract the most footfall. It's all very well having luxury handbags, jewellery and other high value items available, but does it really appeal to the majority of passengers? Travellers from certain countries may have money to indulge in luxury items, but I believe most would want a last minute memento of their holiday knowing they wouldn't face a huge credit card bill when returning home. Plenty of available seating, clear departure boards (also explaining how long to allow for journeys to the gates) and sufficient toilets."
"forget about comfort, privacy, peace",6,H Adams,Slovakia,14th December 2016,✅ Verified Review ," I transited through London Heathrow Terminal 5 and Terminal 3 recently. While terminal 5 seems ok to me, Terminal 3 is not as good. Maybe I just hit a bad day, but on the afternoon of my transit, staff was unhelpful, security just barely ok with cold approach. The transit hall is just too small and too crowded, packed with shops but less eating opportunities. There is not enough seating to accomodate all travellers. Perhaps the worst point are the gates, which are glass-fenced, so one can get into only when boarding starts, and once you are there, you are doomed - no shops, no toilets. Terminal 5, on contrary, is spacious, with plenty of seating, and one can sit wherever. Gates are not fenced and toilets are clean. Gates No.'s are announced only about 30-40 minutes into flight, which keeps people waiting in the main halls so they get crowded. Forget about comfort, privacy, peace, etc LHR is no such airport. If I can avoid LHR in the future, I'll surely do."
"staff smiling, polite and friendly",8,M Graham,United Kingdom,3rd December 2016,unverified,"I had to use London Heathrow twice in 2 weeks due to family emergency in Hong Kong and I was pleasantly surprised. The systems worked smoothly, minimal queues and the staff in all areas were smiling, polite and friendly. Security, shop staff and restaurant staff were all friendly and polite. I never thought I would say it but I now prefer Heathrow to Gatwick. Returning was equally smooth and quick."
the biggest let down of T2 is queuing time,4,J Tung,United Kingdom,1st December 2016,unverified,Used Heathrow T2 for my long haul flight to BKK. I haven't used T2 for a year and it has changed a lot - and unfortunately this is not positive. To avoid possible traffic jam I traveled from London on Heathrow Express. The station at Heathrow is miles away from T2 itself so it involved a lot of walking. That is understandable as Heathrow has few terminals. Check in was fairly easy without a long queue and most of the passengers are required to print out their boarding pass and luggage tag at the machines. The security screen was not well organised at all. So many machines were not manned during peak hours and we waited for at least 30 minutes in the queue. The staff working in the security screen were however very friendly. The main terminal area is clean and there are few shops - the choices not as good as T5 but if you are not into shopping it's not a main concern. When the flight was called we had to walk from T2A to T2B which was again a long journey. Arrival experience echoed departure. Long walk from T2B back to T2A and then faced long queue for passport control. I think the biggest let down of T2 is queuing time.
underneath highly dysfunctional,3,B Anderson,United States,29th November 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  I truly do not get some of the reviews on LHR saying it is good. As a business traveler, I see a lot of different airports. LHR is one if the worst. Nice pretty package with all the fancy shops, but underneath highly dysfunctional. How it is appropriate to assign gates just 20 minutes before boarding when it takes that long to get there if you are lucky. Security lines are slow. Bathrooms need service badly and smell. "
security process and staff are the worst,1,T Stands,United States,27th November 2016,unverified,"What a horrible experience. I've flown through many airports, large to small, various countries, and security process and staff here at London Heathrow are hands down the worst. These jokers make the TSA in the USA look like speedy professionals. Every other bag in the connection security line (meaning all had been through security elsewhere), was being flagged for hand screening - with a guy moving the speed of molasses unpacking every single item, taking 10+ minutes per bag. Not a single word, just monotone bad manners and zero concern for the line of stressed out people in fear of missing their flight. My bag was packed identically to the way it's been packed on dozens of flights, including through LAX, Paris, NYC, etc only here was it necessary for a 45 minutes extra screening with no explanation. I will avoid this airport like the plague in the future. And all the items I planned to buy, nope. LHR gets a 0 from me, and zero of my money."
T2 is a pleasure to use,10,M Dawes,Australia,12th November 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  I recently experienced Heathrow's new T2 The Queen's Terminal for departure. I was aware that Economy pax are required to self-checkin and print boarding passes and lugguage tags, only First and Business have conventional checkin counters. However, as I was travelling with Singapore Airlines in Pemium Economy I was directed to the Business Class checkin counter. So convenient. I was checked in and on my way in three minutes, saving the hassle of trying to decypher the lengthy process at the self-checkin machines, though I do understand they work well. I hope this helps others who travel Premium Economy on any airline, as I suspect this service is available to all. The process through security is much better organised at this new terminal with few hassles, unlike an earlier flight I had made departing from T3. The only downside to my departure was that, as the flight was on an A380, those large aircraft are terminalled at the satellite T2A, which involves around a 20 minute walk, especially hard for elderly pax, though there are travellators. All in all T2 is a pleasure to use."
none of the 10 electronic immigration gates were in operation,5,M Cooper,United Kingdom,8th November 2016,unverified,"Heathrow claims to be a world class international airport yet this morning none of the 10 electronic immigration gates were in operation at terminal 4 at 5.30am despite the fact that my flight from Kuala Lumpur and 2 other planes from the Middle East had landed. The result was a longish queue for those with ""eu"" electronic passports to pass through 4 manual entry points. The explanation given was that they did not open until 6am. Most businesses try to deliver customer service in response to customer demand, i.e. If planes have landed and passengers need to pass immigration why are we not using the latest technology we have no doubt spent considerable sums of money on to provide a first class service when it is required?"
what an awful welcome,1,Michael Wyatt,United Kingdom,5th November 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  
I am English and 69. Heathrow is inefficient, tiring, pedantic and the staff unacquainted with civility. I have used Heathrow 5 times since April 2016, every time an exercise in frustration and temper control, mainly from long queues and empty security bays. Staff know that they have the power to delay and inconvenience and that power is apparent and hovering to be unleashed. I have witnessed women older than myself treated with great disrespect and almost contempt because they were confused or not as nimble as staff want. It is the primary Gateway to London and Britain. What an awful welcome. The old saying 'You never get a second chance to make a first impression' is unknown by Heathrow."
must clear security at least 1 hour before departure,1,Gareth Jones,Australia,31st October 2016,✅ Verified Review ," Draconian rules now apply at London Heathrow Terminal 4. You must clear security at least 1 hour before your flight departure because the security scanning computer will deny you access. When this happens you will have to go back to your airline check-in desk and get them to escort you through. Chances are, by the time you have organised that it will be too late and you will be refused access to the departure lounge. This happened to me and my 14 year old son. We were initially held up with a liquid security scan which had been set up before the security gates and we missed our Etihad flight despite Etihad staff coming from their terminal gate to try and get us through. We were travelling to Australia but that didn't seem to concern the Heathrow airport staff. Rules are Rules. This information should be printed on boarding passes because until it happens most people would be totally unaware of it."
process is quite tiring,6,J Fang,Canada,30th October 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  Flew to LHR from YVR: arrival at T3 on British Airways. Terminal 3 was ok - facilities a little bit dated. A fair amount of walking from aircraft to immigration. Queuing was reasonable and was able to get through immigration in about 15 minutes. During peak times, I can see the airport becoming very crowded. Baggage came out almost instantly upon arrival at the T3 belts. Departure from the new T2 - the new, sleak glass building is an improvement over T3. In the departure hall, there are only two restaurants. They were also fairly overpriced. Once airside, there are more shops, although they also are overpriced. Security queuing was ok - albeit with security staff who were borderline rude and aggressive. One must wait in the main terminal and check the departure screens to find out the gate assignments. For most long-haul flights, one will go down on a super long escalator, walk in a long underground passage, and then come up on another super long escalator. The process is quite tiring and tedious. "
a very pleasant start to our holiday,9,P Weaver,United Kingdom,30th October 2016,✅ Verified Review ," Terminal 2 - because of potential Friday traffic on M25 we arrived very early (3 pm) for an evening flight with Singapore Airlines SQ321 (departing 10 pm). The airport terminal seemed quiet with few queues. We spoke to someone at Singapore Airlines to see what time we could check in, and also whether we could get a seat change because my husband is extra tall and larger than average build. The helpful lady told us check in would be 6 pm but that the supervisor came on duty at 5.30 pm and they would be the best person to speak to regarding this. In the meantime we went to Wetherspoon for a meal whilst we waited and the staff there were very helpful too. We reported to the Singapore Airlines check in at 5.30 pm and we were immediately passed through to a member of staff to try and make the necessary changes. She was helpful and put us in touch with a staff member who was helpful to accommodate us. We made our way through to departure which went smoothly. Whilst waiting for our gate to come up I noticed a sign for special assistance. The walk to the gate would have taken 15 minutes and my husband who has knee problems would have been ill walking for that amount of time so I approached the special assistance area and they arranged to take us to the gate on their vehicles. All in all a very pleasant start to our holiday. "
a fantastic terminal,8,Craig Beck,Cyprus,23rd October 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  Heathrow terminal 5 is a fantastic terminal. The airport is modern, efficient and well equipped. The security process can be a bit slow and even though airlines claim you need one hour to clear security and change flight I would not feel comfortable with anything less that 90 mins."
immigration unpleasant and inefficient,3,Gloria Wong,Singapore,7th October 2016,unverified,"I've flown to and from Heathrow airport (particularly terminal 3) at least once a year in the last 6 years. The departure area is appallingly crowded, particularly where the food and beverage shops are located. It's the only airport where I don't feel comfortable enough to sit and have a drink before my flight. The overall airport isn't actually too bad with many shopping options before departure. As for arrival, it's almost always an unpleasant experience since 3 years ago when my university forgot to notify the border control that my student visa should be cancelled a year early. I'd very honestly explained that I'd be entering as a tourist (without requiring a visa) and not a student the first time, and my visa shouldn't be valid. On hindsight, I should've just lied. The friendly officer helped me put out a notice to change my status and let me through. However each time I land since, I've had to go through the same ordeal of being put in a holding area, unpleasantly treated and barked at like I'm trying to sneak in and stay on in the country until they verify whatever it is they needed to verify and grudgingly let me through. The whole process often takes over an hour without considering the long queues at immigration. The officers here are thoroughly unpleasant and inefficient and I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone."
T3 was beyond busy,6,Angelo Menezes,Portugal,5th October 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  T5 was just fine, although the signs to change terminal were not clear. Fortunately, I know it well enough to know I can take Heathrow Express. I do not understand, however, how can a 747 (BA202) full of people be offloaded onto buses. T3 was beyond busy, which is expected. I tried to find a lounge to sleep, to find it only just before boarding, so I guess I was either too tired or the signs were not clear enough. The wifi also failed at times. I would suggest some kind of renovation on T3. I found it too crammed with some outdated areas."
Heathrow has something special about it,8,Christopher Short,United Kingdom,4th October 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  As a place, Heathrow has something special about it. No other airport I've visited has quite managed to grasp that sheer feeling of international wonder, the way Heathrow does. Call me crazy, but I really do love the size of the place. It adds to that excitement, knowing you are one of many - travelling to goodness knows where in the world. I love how beautifully modern each terminal is, even number 3 which is in obvious need of renovation comparatively to 2 and 5. Once through security, the place is practically a gigantic mall, anything you need - you'll be able to find. To be fair, for someone new to Heathrow airport, I can understand why the place may seem like a labyrinth, especially if travelling from one terminal to the next. As a Londoner, I practically know the airport inside-out, so for me personally that isn't an issue. Similarly, walking for me isn't really a problem - although I can see why for others it may be. Even if there may be more than your average doddle to the gate, the airport does actually tell you how many minutes away the gate is, which is quite useful. The staff generally are nice, of course at the border you occasionally catch the odd grump. They normally help you swiftly and are patient with fuming travellers. Queuing times are an issue, however. Be ready to wait a long time if you are an international / non-EU traveller headed to the UK. For me, baggage can often be a nightmare in Terminal 3, especially when they take such a long time to start loading the bags on. The only other bone I'd like to pick is with the WiFi. It's alright - but upon me making skype calls, it constantly stops working, or breaks up. Perhaps I'm being spoilt, expecting high-speed WiFi from the airport, but it's far too on / off and I never find any decent consistency with it. When I'm at Heathrow, I honestly am happier just to stay on data, it's way less of a hassle. I'm constantly in and out of Heathrow, but I'm happy to call it my favourite UK airport. Upon departure, the place always gives me that huge burst of energy and excitement - it's definitely something about the architecture and general ethos of the place. I also love the shopping features and terminal layouts. It's really a magnificent airport. Beware for baggage / customs waits, however. Don't forget to also have a space GB of data on you, as I find the WiFi to be pretty inconsistent."
Heathrow is vastly inferior,4,Imtiaz Quwailid,United Kingdom,2nd October 2016,unverified,"Used Heathrow Terminal 2 to travel to Warsaw with LOT Polish Airlines. Outbound departure was at 06:30. As I try to stick to a 3 hour check-in rule, we checked in at 03:45. There was some queuing involved at check-in due to multiple airlines using the same set of desks. However, we were checked in quickly and went to go airside. For an airport claiming to be a major international hub, and wanting to expand, Heathrow appears to open for business quite late. We joined a queue before security, and were told that security would open at 05:00. About 40 minutes later (and 20 minutes before Security opened), the single queue was allowed to become multiple queues. We watched as passengers who checked in 30 minutes after us, suddenly appeared ahead of us in other queues. At 05:10, we were herded through into the security area. The process of going through the scanners was quick (less than 5 minutes from joining the back of the queue to putting my belt back on). Once airside we were looking forward to buying some last minute gifts for family, and grabbing a bite to eat. However, the World Duty Free shop did not open until 06:00, and the food outlets were only just opening so we had a very limited amount of time before running to gate B33 for our flight. And no chance for breakfast. A long distance to the gate via down escalator, tunnel (with travelator) that runs under the taxiway and the up escalator in the satellite building. You feel exhausted and rushed by the time you arrive at the gate. At least the flight proved better than the airport experience. Returning back to Terminal 2 proved equally frustrating. Flight landed on time, but as the aircraft exited the runway (27L) at the farthest point from the terminal, it was a long taxi to the gate. After deplaning there was the long walk back to the main terminal, to join the converging crowds at passport control. As British/EU passport holders, we were instructed to use the automated booths instead of queuing at the faster moving manned desks. Given that about 1 in 3 arriving passengers had issues with getting through the booths, this process needs to be improved. In order for me to go through, I had to try twice (removing my glasses for the second attempt). The facial recognition software needs to be able to allow for glasses/headware etc. Otherwise real bottlenecks will occur. However, we got through and made our way to Carousel 4 in the baggage hall. The screen above the belt said the bags were arriving, and I was reunited with my case within a couple of minutes. However, after 40 minutes, my wife's case hadn't arrived and other passengers from our flight were also waiting. We asked an attendant who said that all the bags had arrived and should be there. Clearly they weren't so the group went to the enquiries desk. Another attendant said he would need to check ""downstairs"" and after 10 minutes said there was a delay with the baggage handlers but that the outstanding luggage would appear shortly. The flight landed at 21:45 and we finally got out of the terminal at 23:30. Not a great experience all things considered, and it does beg the question that if the airport is running at 98% operational capacity, how will adding a third runway improve the situation? I fly out of Heathrow not because I want to, but because of necessity (I work close by, so it is handy to get to). Compared to some other hub airports, Heathrow is vastly inferior."
whole process is nothing short of excruciating,1,M King,Australia,2nd October 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  This airport is absolutely woeful. I arrived with my 11 year old after a very long flight from Australia and a long transit in Asia. We got off our 14 hour flight at 9pm absolutely exhausted and all we wanted to do was get to our hotel, shower and go to bed. But, unfortunately, we were faced with the longest queue at passport control in which we had no choice but to stand and wait in for over an hour. I cannot fathom how this airport functions and why it cannot process people within normal time frames like most other international airports. Yes, I get that Heathrow is a large and busy airport but do they seriously think that this is the way that people want to start their holidays? Border control staff look bored out of their minds and the whole process is nothing short of excruciating. I couldn't even log onto wifi to pass the time as it kept dropping out. When we finally got to the window the staff member wanted to make small talk with me and ask inane questions about my holiday. Seriously, stamp my passport and just let me go, I have zero desire to make small talk after standing in a miserable queue for an hour! There isn't even someone to usher forth those in line with young children, there was a family with a very irritable baby and toddler and they, like everyone else, had to just stand and suffer. Just appalling and I will avoid this place like the plague on any further trips to London.
"
woefully inadequate for the number of arrivals,2,Mitch Little,Australia,30th September 2016,unverified,"UK Border control numbers in Terminal 4 were woefully inadequate for the number of arrivals. We arrived from Paris on time and there were several other flights that were either late or early that meant we had close to 1000 people waiting to clear Border control. It took 30 minutes to reach the ""45 minutes wait to this point"" sign and from there another 70 minutes to clear Border control. Less than half the control points were manned and 2 hours is totally unacceptable for this process. I lost my pre-arranged transport (but still had to pay for it) and then had to pay for a taxi. Heathrow get your act together. Looking back at Border control performance measures they have failed to reach their target of <45minutes for the past 5 months. I'm not sure why 45 minutes is the acceptable criteria. I don't think I have ever had to queue for more than 30 minutes at any major airport I have been through."
one of the best airports,10,Bors Ilic,Croatia,26th September 2016,unverified,"Definitelly one of the best airports in the world. Modern, clean, excellent facilities and superb signage. This is definitely the airport you can't get lost at. This was my first time at LHR and I never had to stop to read the signs or to orient myself. Just breezed through as I was there every day. This will definitely be my hub as frequent as possible. Not to mention the United Club lounge, which is among the top ones."
ample shopping and dining options,6,D Anderson,United States,23rd September 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  Transited round-trip between Heathrow's Terminal 3 (Virgin Atlantic) and Terminal 4 (Jet Airways). If you are an experienced traveler, you will do fine while changing terminals at LHR. There are a couple of areas where the signage is a bit confusing, but I figured my way out. However, for other less experienced (or nervous) travelers, I wouldn't recommend an itinerary where you have to change terminals at London Heathrow. Both T3 and T4 at Heathrow have ample shopping and dining options. I liked T4 better than T3 since it is easier to locate your Boarding gate. In T3, the boarding gates are far away from the ""Shopping and Dining"" areas. Also, the boarding areas in T3 are protected by glass and you cannot enter that area and sit on the chairs unless you are traveling on that particular flight."
I was pleasantly surprised,8,T Harvey,United Kingdom,22nd September 2016,unverified,"Used Terminal 3 for Virgin Atlantic to LAX and onwards by Delta to Honolulu. Having thus sampled both USA airports I am able to compare them with Terminal 3 within the same time frame. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Very clean restrooms - LAX and HON both disgusting with toilet paper scattered on the floors. Terminal well signposted - got lost at LAX. Border Control on Monday lunchtime return small queues. Luggage already on belt upon arrival at Baggage Reclaim. Only draw back was the long walk to the Underground, but at least most was by 'moving walkway' so was not particularly arduous. Normally a committed 'Mr Grumpy' in relation to the experience of airports, but I found the Terminal a relative pleasure."
a last resort from now on,1,Will Thompson,United Kingdom,20th September 2016,unverified,It's embarrassing that we spend millions of pounds on Heathrow T2 and yet they can't do a simple passport control check without huge queues. The e-passport system has about a 25% failure rate so you have to queue again. Signage is appalling and navigating around is not a simple route. Will use Heathrow as a last resort from now on.
everything is so far away and so slow,3,H Morrison,United Kingdom,17th September 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  London Heathrow T5 is terrible. Everything is so far away and so slow. After arriving, we had to wait so long for a transit train. All I wanted was to get through the airport quickly, go home and see my kid. T5 is a waste of time, which I consider the worst possible criticism for any airport."
such a horrible experience,2,Prabhu Mohan,United Kingdom,17th September 2016,unverified,I flew British Airways from Brussels. The flight journey was just 1 hour to reach London but the immigration made me to wait in the queue for almost 2 hours. They have around 20 counters but only 5 counters were active to attend to more than 200 people. Such a horrible experience.
all the escalators were not working,2,Murielle Kay,Cyprus,31st August 2016,✅ Verified Review ,"  Arrived at Terminal 5 at 22.30. Had to take train to the arrivals hall. Hall is two floors up and all the escalators were not working. Only 3 lifts, one of which was not working. Climbed two flights of steps. After immigration one set of escalators to baggage hall were not working. Bags arrived about one hour after landing.
"
was expecting so much more,6,Chris Coates,Australia,29th August 2016,unverified,"First time in Heathrow Terminal five. Thought as the newest terminal this would be something special but while it is clean and tidy I was surprised at confusing signage, long distances to travel, limited toilets on arrival and generally a poor cousin architecturally of many newer airports. Rather disappointed as was expecting so much more than other messy, aging parts of the airport. Recommend compared to other Heathrow arrivals though."
horrible airport to transit through,1,K Haymes,Germany,27th August 2016,✅ Verified Review ," Arrived on a transatlantic flight to Heathrow terminal 3 transiting to a BA flight. Passport control was a substantial wait and appeared understaffed. Though BA has a presence in T3, the airport (unlike most every airport in the world) cannot manage to get a bag from T3 to T5, my departure terminal. T5 fast track security was abysmal, understaffed, with outdated equipment that contributed to the wait. On top of all this the fees are significantly higher than other European airports. Bottom line, Heathrow is a horrible airport to transit through."
really unpleasant experience,1,M Samuels,United Kingdom,23rd August 2016,✅ Verified Review ," Security staff London Heathrow Terminal 2 are the rudest, unhelpful and slowest airport staff you will ever come across. Most of the staff just stand around doing nothing while passengers try to get through security as quickly and easy as possible. A really unpleasant experience."
plenty of seats at gates,9,Miles Damone,Russian Federation,23rd August 2016,unverified,"It was school holidays but barely any traffic to London Heathrow. We parked in the long stay car park. It's very cheap and easy to book online. When we got there was lots of spaces. We parked and took a the personal rapid transport which leaves every 3 seconds carrying 4-6 people taking you to the terminal in less than 5 minutes. When you arrive in Terminal 5 it's only BA so there are basically 200 bag drops so there are never queues. Then you have 2 security's to get through quickly. Then you find yourself in front of Harrods, Gordon Ramsey plane food or WHsmith etc. Also there are 5 lounges for frequent flyers, buisness class passengers and first. If you can't go into the lounge there are coffee shops and a lot more. The airport is very child friendly as it has lots of kids magazines to buy and a mini playground. Then if your gate is A it's close if it's B or C it's further away. But it's only 2 minutes to each part. Staff speak lots of languages and there are lots of signs and plenty of seats at gates. The wifi is free."
queuing was absolutely and utterly appalling,8,Lindsay McKee,United Kingdom,21st August 2016,unverified,"Everything at this airport was fine, but, honestly, the exception was Border Control where the queuing was absolutely and utterly appalling. One occupied desk, a very large queue. Mind you, the staff were reasonably polite. One would find a better arrangement in some 3rd world airports. What on earth has gone wrong here. This is the nation's flagship airport. This serious flaw needs addressing, urgently. Actual security and customs were a breeze. That said our dining experience was utterly superb, especially at Wagamama in terminal 5, professional staff here. Shopping was good, service could be a little warmer in some of the posher establishments. Apart from Border Control, everything was good. I would still recommend this airport."
it was a piece of cake,9,Jak Nguyen,Finland,18th August 2016,unverified,"Travel from Helsinki terminal 2 to London Heathrow terminal 3. Finnair flight AY831 arrived on time at 9.10 am. Then very long walk from gate to UK border control (10-15 minutes). Had EU and biometric passport, so it was easy to use E-gate for passport control. There were queues but it went quickly using this automated control, less than 5 minutes waiting time. There were customer service onsite to instruct you in case you needed. Then waiting for luggage was less than 10 minutes. Before arriving to Heathrow, I had read reviews and most of them complain about 45 minutes waiting time in passport control. This might be true with live person checking but with automated passport control it was a piece of cake. Went back on Sunday 14th, 2016 with AY996 at 7.35 pm. Checked 36 hours beforehand with Finnair mobile application to get great seats. At Heathrow in baggage drop, the customer service asked to weight all person cabin bags since we had only 1 pc of checked baggage. That was quite weird since this did not happen in Helsinki when we departured. Anyhow, I had prepare already at home by weighing all cabin bags to be less than 8 kg. So I didn't have any trouble with this incident. After that went to security control and everything went smoothly. Waiting time around 5 minutes. Flight arrived to Helsinki 20 minutes earlier."
abysmal staff planning,1,Paul Clark,Switzerland,16th August 2016,unverified,1 agent and 5 empty desks at Border Control in mid-August. Unfathomnable planning on behalf of Customs. I've been consistently shocked by the abysmal staff planning in Terminal 5 but this degree of lack of foresight is incomprehensible. I will admit the people are friendly when you finally reach them. Unfortunately the wait yields less than friendly customers.
good experiences all around,7,Rachel Ernst,United Kingdom,14th August 2016,unverified,"I feel like sometimes I'm the only person on the planet who likes Heathrow airport. I transfer through Terminal 5 at least 6 times a year for the last 5 years, usually during the height of holiday seasons, and I have had good experiences all around. Even this last Christmas going through with a broken foot in a wheelchair by myself, the assistants were great and one even went to coffee with me because we got to the gate so early. The longest I've ever had to wait through immigration was an hour (I came in the same time as a plane full of people with difficult visas) and my fastest from plane door to terminal shopping (that's with immigration and security) was 20 minutes. There's loads of seating, wonderful clean bathrooms, free wifi and a bright atmosphere even when the sky is gloomy."
unimpressed,3,E French,Australia,11th August 2016,unverified,"Currently sitting in terminal 2, 2.5 hours early for a flight and there is no smokers area (LHR is a non smoking airport). I apologise in advance to the crew who are going to have to deal with me on the 13 hour flight to Singapore. Other than that Heston's restaurant is nice."
no help available when needed,3,Elaine Rustad,Canada,9th August 2016,unverified,"I did not heed advice and chose to route my travel through there, mistakenly thought it would be easier as it is English-speaking. Frankfurt airport proved far easier to navigate in spite of the language. Airport is understaffed for a main travel hub, no help available when needed."
queue was well managed,9,Usman Gul Mohammed,United Kingdom,9th August 2016,unverified,"As I entered terminal 3, I easily found the check-in desk with a long queue however the queue was well managed and moved quickly. The terminal was quite clean and they offered free wifi. As I made my way upstairs there were machines that scanned your boarding pass making the process much quicker and easier. There were plenty of staff available at security guiding us through to the correct queues. There were plenty of shops inside such as restaurants and duty free. Overall, I had a pleasant time at this airport."
nothing proud to come home too,2,R Gee,United Kingdom,7th August 2016,unverified,"Border control at London Heathrow was ok, fairly quick to process. Staff at the security section were simply rude and unhelpful. Heard one member of staff complaining about people saying they needed to catch a flight. Is this not the purpose of an airport? Restaurant staff were busy but still polite so no reason security staff can't be. The general level of unhelpful staff at Heathrow was such a stark contrast to Canada (3 airports to compare against). Nothing proud to come home too."
waiting for family,1,David Langford,United Kingdom,7th August 2016,unverified,"Sitting in London Heathrow writing this review. Waiting for a family member who landed 2.5 hours ago and is still in the passport control queue, and not even near the front. Possibly another hour from the desks. And they want to build another runway? They can't even manage with what they've got."
only 2-7 workers,1,Natalia Par,Israel,29th July 2016,unverified,"Arrived at 21.00, at the line for UK border control we had to wait for 2 and a half hours, for 300+ people there were only 2-7 workers. We almost were late to the underground and if we had been the next train would not have arrived until 6am in the morning. We were so angry about this and we are not recomending Heathrow."
improve biometric passport systems,3,J Kelly,United Kingdom,25th July 2016,unverified,"Something needs to be done to improve passport control at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5. I'm talking about the biometric passport machine systems. Despite several attempts, along with several other passengers the machine did not work. It took quite a few attempts before it did. The levels of stress to the staff who are employed there must be severe as they take the brunt of the passengers' frustration. Some of the staff try to make excuses for the machines and why they are not working efficiently. It's nice to see loyalty in staff but no one is buying the explanations. I had just returned from overseas. Despite heavy usage of the biometric machines in that airport the machine worked flawlessly each time. I would normally give Heathrow a good rating and it's a shame that I have to give it such a low rating this time, but something needs to change where those machines are concerned."
smoother than most airports,9,Anurag Dave,United States,25th July 2016,unverified,"If you love plane spotting, Terminal 2 at Heathrow is one of the best in the world! Security screening and boarding at Terminal 2 is significantly smoother than most airports around the world. The long walk inside Terminal 2 might remind you of Chicago O'Hare. When you are arriving at Heathrow T2, there is often a long line at Border Control. When you step out of the terminal, the elevators for Hoppa Bus (to hotels) are different from the elevators for Heathrow Express (train to central London)."
directions are clear,7,Angela Muranyi,United Kingdom,25th July 2016,unverified,"We had a flight to Tenerife with Iberia from Heathrow Terminal 5. The first flight was operated by British Airways. We couldn't check in online, neither at a self check in desk, so we headed to a counter where the new system didn't accept our travel documents. Luckily the lady was so helpful, smiling and patiient. We were there for about 20 minutes, but she didn't give up until the problem was solved. We had a really positive experience. Also, this was the first time we had a flight from Heathrow, I was afraid a little because the airport is huge, but directions are clear so you can't get lost. And to get here from the other side of London was just 3-4 pounds per person. If I travel from other airports it's more expensive usually. "
they were constantly under-staffed,1,Dr John Moore,United Kingdom,22nd July 2016,unverified,"Heathrow are asking for a new runway, but they can't look after the traffic they have now. Its frustrating to us all to have to be at the airport two hours before departure, but who knew it took 2-and-a-half hours to get out of the airport after arrival? Our flight from Dubai landed on time but there were only two passport checkers for all UK passport holders in Terminal 3 (not just our flight), that's two people checking passports against a queue of several hundred people. It took us over 45 minutes just to have our passport checked (and staff said that non-UK passport holders regularly have to wait over two hours) and when I complained to the checker he agreed that it was ridiculous that there were only two of them to check so many people, that they complained all the time to management but management wouldn't provide more staff. We then went to claim our baggage from carousel 6, but the carousel was stopped and we could only find 2 of our 4 bags. We were told the other bags were waiting outside for a blockage to be cleared. There were loads of staff hanging around, but none of them could solve the problem, the baggage desk begged us to complain to Heathrow online (there wasn't anyone to complain to at the airport) as their regular complaints were ignored. They agreed that the service at Heathrow was rubbish and said that they had complaints all the time. It took well over an hour before we could retrieve our bags and then we just walked through customs (there wasn't anybody there!). All the staff we talked to agreed that Heathrow was a terrible place to work, that they were constantly under-staffed and under-resourced. All the travellers we spoke to were fed up and several said that, like me, they will avoid Heathrow if at all possible in the future. I usually use Bristol, Exeter or Birmingham, and have never had such awful service at any airport in the UK or elsewhere. "
didn't get lost once,6,Stacey Winters,Australia,22nd July 2016,unverified,"I went through Madrid, Lisbon, Barcelona and Hong Kong airports on my last trip but I have to say Heathrow is the best in regards to signage. I didn't get lost once at Heathrow whereas Madrid was a total nightmare trying to navigate my way to the correct bus stop. Their customer information desk attendants need to smarten up their act. They were more interested in their mobile phones and talking to each other than doing their job. Boarder control, well they always drive me batty. I know they are just doing their job but I come to England for a holiday, repeat holiday, not to work."
stuck at immigration for almost 2 hours,2,A Sini,United Kingdom,20th July 2016,unverified,"Departing from Heathrow is a more pleasant experience that other UK airports due to location and pretty smooth departure process. However arriving really make you wish you had chosen Gatwick or Stansted. The extra miles from these airports are really worth it. Last time, the airport was over saturated so had to fly over London for an extra 30 minutes circling and circling - nice views over London though. Then last night, I got stuck at immigration for almost 2 hours! longer than the duration of my EU flight. Only 2 officers at UK Border to check 1000s of arrivals, very long queues, stuck in narrow corridors on high heat, people were exhausted, poor, nonexistent customer care from Heathrow staff. It really makes you feel unwelcome."
assistance offered was terrible,1,C Young,United Kingdom,18th July 2016,unverified,"I have used British Airways for a number of years and both myself and my family are Bronze members. During the last year I have noticed a drop in the service that they provide. I always try to use BA wherever I can because they are a homegrown company and in the past they have served me well. This looks like it is coming to an abrupt end and the level of service is plummeting. I had a bad experience a few weeks ago on the 23rd of June whilst travelling with wheelchair assistance passengers to Tegal Airport Berlin. Both the outward and inward flights were delayed. Being a Bronze member and that there were no business class flights available, I asked if I and my disabled passengers could have access to the club lounge where they would be more comfortable as the delay was no fault of ours. The response was rude and unwelcome. I was told that if I wanted to use the lounges then I should have booked business class. Not the response I would have expected from a frequent and loyal user of British Airways. I tried to ask another member of staff but was redirected back to the same manager at business class check-in. The return flight was no better, this also was delayed and my wheelchair passengers were left in their wheelchairs to await the delayed flight. I know that British Airways have no control of assistance at Tegel airport, but the situation was even worse when we returned to Heathrow. I was the lead passenger travelling in a family group with wheelchair assistance passengers. When we arrived at Heathrow, the assistance offered was terrible. The driver of the buggy would not let us travel together as a family and wanted to split us up. I had to call a manager to resolve the situation but not before causing considerable distress to my assistance passengers. The assistance operative was very rude indeed and accused us of telling lies when we informed him that we travelled as a family on the way out. Not a good state of affairs."
I sailed through everything,9,D O'Brien,United Kingdom,12th July 2016,unverified,"BA texted passengers that they were expecting Heathrow (T5) to be very busy, and recommended checking in online. Taking their advice, I did so, and gave extra time thinking I would be stuck in queues at security etc. I was happily surprised to find this was not the case. I sailed through everything in less than ten minutes, a very acceptable time for this. The airport was busy, but I filled my time with a little shopping, and enjoyed a breakfast at the cafe that has replaced the rather grotty pub near the domestic gates. It was a marked improvement. T5 remains a better experience than most terminals."
only good things to say,10,Stevan Harding,United Arab Emirates,4th July 2016,unverified,"It is only when you visit airports like Heathrow that you appreciate how truly awful other airports are. Only good things to say apropos recent experience at T4, including arrival - immigration cleared and bags delivered within 15 minutes. Customs well signposted - to claim back the dreaded VAT. Check in, smooth and hassle free. Security robust and efficient, but always handled with a smile. More than ample seating throughout the terminal. Excellent wifi. And refreshments at High Street prices - don't forget to say 'yes' when asked if your coffee and food are take away, and avoid the VAT!"
I almost missed my flight,3,Yuki Hoshino,United States,4th July 2016,unverified,Unbelievably slow security lane. One person took about 1 minute on average and there were 40 people in front of me so it took 40 minutes. Other airports usually take 10-15 for that amount of people. It wasn't even the security. The ticket and passport check to enter the security zone was slow. I'm not sure if they were just having problems with ticketing but I almost missed my flight due to this slow lane. And the transfer between terminals is a nightmare. Everything takes three times as much energy and time it would take in other airports.
makes hopeless look good,1,Sally-Ann Parker,Australia,16th June 2016,unverified,"Where to start with London Heathrow - an airport that is so hopeless it makes hopeless look good. Took a flight today from Rome which was roughly an 1.5 hours and then took an hour and 50 minutes to clear customs. Queues (for non-Europeans/UK passport holders) was staggering and simply unacceptable. Took an hour simply to get to the immigration hall. Most distressing of all was to see the extremely poor handling of elderly customers and those with a disability. They were only allowed to use one gate and took even longer than the rest of us. When I got to the immigration officer and told her how we'd waited she shrugged and said that's the price you pay to visit a beautiful country. Poor attitude but somewhat explains the hopelessness. Low standards. Whole thing was inefficient and poorly run. The biggest laugh - Heathrow's slogan is ""Making every journey better"". The only good thing was the crowd spent so much time in the queue we started to bond. Whoever is in charge, get some tips from Changi or Hong Kong which are also busy but still run within acceptable limits."
no thought at T5 for the poor traveller,1,George Calledaway,Switzerland,13th June 2016,unverified,"I arrived at C gates T5 at 23.25 on 12th June. Transfer was good to immigration, but that's where the trouble started. All e gates were closed, apparently they should close at 23.00 but opening was extended due to passenger load. This loading was still evident way after midnight. Finally cleared immigration only to wait another 40 mins for baggage to arrive. Tannoy announcement made that because the plane was so far away it would take an extra 15mins. The shuttle train from c gates proudly displayed that your baggage travels at 30mph but I guess that was not the case last night. Finally got the baggage and headed for the customs exit nearest to the underground only to find that it was ""roped"" off. This meant walking to the exit at the other end of the baggae hall in the opposite direction to that needed to exit for ground transportation. There should have been notices explaining that one exit was closed, but there seems to be absolutely no thought at T5 for the poor traveller. Exited to baggage area theough the half open door with a broken door closure. Headed for the Underground exit only to find that there were trolleys blocking the exit doors, again no notice to say that it was closed, no helpful note to say the the underground Station was closed, but there are buses to central London. I caught the N9 from the ""local buses"" stop. Do you really expect visitors to your country to expect a local bus to go all the way to Central London. Please please have some thought about visitors and help them, because at the moment the whole attitude seems to be ""couldn't care less""."
very difficult to find,3,Ben Milner,United Kingdom,10th June 2016,unverified,Purple parking at London Heathrow give the impression of a very professional car parking service with off site parking speedy transfers etc. The car park is very difficult to find and not very well signed either in or outside. The car park itself is in a horrific state and is quite some distance from London Heathrow. Transfers are as and when required. The ticket given to you when dropping off your car says to call them upon your arrival as soon as you get off the plane then the transfer will be waiting. I did this and was held on the line for 17 minutes at 3p a minute and had actually collected my bags and was outside the airport by the time someone answered the call. For the sake of an extra £10 I will be booking meet and greet next time and saving all the hassle.
an own goal here in arrivals,5,Ben Milner,United Kingdom,9th June 2016,unverified,"Departure facilities at Heathrow T5 are very good, plenty of shops, restaurants and bars all in close proximity of each other. Friendly helpful staff and very clean airport. Easy to find gates due to excellent signage and generally very good all round. Inbound is a different story, several escalators taking you both up and down to then have to wait 10 minutes for a train, which is more like a universal studios ride than an airport transfer. Passport control is ridiculous with nowhere near enough staff manning the desks, EU passport holders queuing for almost an hour on my last journey while non-EU straight through. Baggage reclaim area is very big with plenty of trollies. Overall I think BA have scored a bit of an own goal here and more thought should have gone into arrivals where the majority of people are tired and just want to get home."
minimum connection times impossible to make,1,J Dayton,United States,8th June 2016,unverified,"Heathrow airport sets minimum connection times for flights arriving and leaving the same terminal so short it is impossible to make them. The redundant checking of people and baggage slows processing for the mere act of changing planes in transit. A person running through the terminal could not make the connection even though the arriving flight landed ""early"". Why anyone would rate an airport high because the shopping is good baffles me. Who goes to an airport to shop? "
understaffed and a complete shambles,1,Pat Marwick,United Kingdom,7th June 2016,unverified,"A ghastly experience at London Heathrow. Arrived from Boston and landed at 10.50am. We were travelling on to Glasgow and had a long layover. 1 staff member at the UK border was trying to deal with 3 queues at once - grossly understaffed and a complete shambles. Security was a farce. My bag was 'rejected' by the machine and was moved to join a queue of others to be opened and checked by one of 2 members of staff. One worked quickly and got people on their way. The other could not have gone any slower. My bag was'rejected' because I had not opened the amenity bag given to me onboard and had not transferred the tiny lotions to the polythene bag that they insist on. We walked into the Galleries Lounge at 12.15pm, exactly 1h25m after landing. The queue of people waiting to have 'rejected' bags checked was outrageous. An American couple beside me missed their flight because of it."
rude and unhelpful,2,Suzanne Houghton,United Kingdom,5th June 2016,unverified,"My husband, myself and my twin girls (aged 13 months) were travelling to Lisbon and on arrival back to Heathrow we were informed that TAP (our airline) would only provide the buggy at the luggage pick up spot. When we asked for support from Heathrow staff we found the staff to be rude and unhelpful saying that there were many families standing in the line and they weren't able to help us. To be clear there were many families but all had two parents to one baby (twin parents don't have that luxury). We asked if we could have help with either our hand luggage, a temporary buggy, or a faster queue - we were told no to all of the above and to stand in line. Personally I don't understand why an airport provides assistance during departure when families have access to a buggy and yet no support on arrival when there are no buggies available. Overall a disappointing experience - this is in contrast to Gatwick who provided support on the way out and return. Also when I asked the Heathrow ambassador how to complain - the response was I don't know - I'll phone my manager. So helpful but ill equipped to provide any support."
little bit dated,8,Attila Toth,United Kingdom,5th June 2016,unverified,"Heathrow Terminal 4 is a small, little bit dated, but friendly terminal, completely separated from the other terminals (1-3, 5) of Heathrow. It is mainly used by Delta, Etihad, Alitalia, Qatar Airways and several other airlines. It has a great passenger drop-off area for free if you arrived by car to the airport. When you arrive by tube, you must use several escalators to reach the Departures floor (or take an elevator).The escalators are a bit inconvenient because all are surrounded by bollards restraining trolleys, so you may need to lift up your larger piece of luggage. There are limited number of seating, shops and phone charger sockets in the departures hall."
security staff were unpleasant,1,Ann Campbell,United States,1st June 2016,unverified,"Horrible airport. Arrived from Basel. We had approximately one hour to find our plane. We had to transfer to Terminal 3. There were approximately 70 people waiting for small buses heading to Terminal 3. Buses were full and kept passing by because they were full. We were directed to another area to catch a bus at the beginning of its route. Traveled up and down and down and up escalators through long corridors. Finally found a bus leaving for Terminal 3 at the beginning of its route. Had to pass through security. Security staff were unpleasant, shouting at passengers and many were doing nothing but standing around. When we got to our gate the gate was closing. In the space of approximately 10 feet our passports were checked four times. Four times by people standing close enough to each other to talk to each other and see that our passports were checked. Awful experience. It was like getting caught in a maze."
possibly has some of the best shopping,8,M Adlawan,United States,23rd May 2016,unverified,"When flying to Europe I usually pass through LHR. LHR possibly has some of the best shopping. Their customs line is always long once you reach the terminal. Usually if you are passing thru and London is your last stop before heading back to the US. The customs line is long. If you fly straight out of LHR back to US the line is shorter for customs right by the check-in counters. Overall I think LHR after some of their improvements to T5 are really stepping up their game. I wish SFO would take a tip or two from LHR. Security is strict in LHR. You must pass thru security at least 1-hr before departure at least is the case when flying Virgin Atlantic. So if you are connecting be sure that you either purchase your connections on the same ticket or allow a few hours between flights in case of cancellations/delays/changes to departure time. I experienced a change in departure time. My flight was not until December but I purchased my tickets in July. Changes to my flights were made in September. My travel agency never informed me. If I would've used TripIt app back then I would have known and made adjustments. Moral of the story I missed my flight back home to US. I had to pay extra to change my flights for the next day plus hotel. It was my own darn fault but lesson learned. Positive side, extra night in London and excellent evening out. One of the biggest gripes for travelers are the airport fees. It is a shame."
a very nice experience,9,D Jones,United Kingdom,22nd May 2016,unverified,"Terminal 5 at Heathrow was a pure pleasure. 9:00am fight to Paris called for arrival at 7:00am. The lifts from the Tube station ran frequently and were uncrowded. Check-in was automated and unbelievably quick. Queues for security were short and fast-running. Terminal building is huge and full of quality shops and restaurants. BA lounge was understandably busy at that time if day, but I found a comfortable seat and enjoyed a bacon roll and coffee. Flight information was clear. Seating area at gate was plentiful. Return journey the same evening was smooth and uncomplicated. Queues at passport control moved swiftly. A very nice experience. Compliments to a well-run airport."
queues ridiculously long,2,M Neave,United Kingdom,21st May 2016,unverified,"Arrived Heathrow Terminal 3 after a US holiday, long, long walk from the plane to the border control area and when there the queues were ridiculously long and this is the UK/EU passport control to enter your own country. Why is it that at that time of day when they know a lot of international flights will be arriving over half the desks are not manned? It took over an hour to get through. I much preferred my last trip on Delta when I arrived at Terminal 4, off the plane and through passport control to pick up my bags in 20 mins."
queues for passport check were horrendous,1,Sheena Williams,United Kingdom,21st May 2016,unverified,"Plane landed ten minutes early on the 18th May 2016 - I only had hand baggage thus expected to clear Border Control quickly and get out to my son who was meeting me and had to get to work soon after. I have a Bio-metric passport. Queues for passport check were horrendous and took much more than half-an-hour to clear. There has to be a better system for this aspect. I noticed a sign to 'register for faster exit' (using the Bio-metric gates) and have just accessed this information to find that you have to pay £70.00 per annum for the privilege of going through the Bio-metric gates. What a load of rubbish. Whilst I realise, and agree, that border controls have got to be exercised these queues are not acceptable, neither are the delays, and all it achieves are very disgruntled passengers and the ruination of a wonderful holiday (or business trip) spent out of the UK. I would urge all airports in the UK to rethink their procedures for Border Control and find a way to minimise the queues and waiting time and try ensure that people/passengers feel like valued human being and not a herd of cattle."
airport staff extremely friendly,8,J Tung,United Kingdom,19th May 2016,unverified,"Used Heathrow T5 in May for a trip to New York. Departure experience was per expected. As it's a terminal exclusively for BA the check in area is well laid out and no queue. Security didn't take more than 5 minutes (in my case it's faster than the fast track), and after security there are numerous shops and could get busy. It is airy and spacious. Airport staff, including the security, was extremely friendly. My flight left from T5C which is a short train ride from the main terminal. Flight took off with delay which is normal in Heathrow. Return journey after a long weekend was even better than the departure experience. The airport was not busy, and it didn't take me more than 30 minutes from leaving the plane, traveled from T5C to T5A, clear immigration and collect luggage. Overall a great experience and what a contrast to T3 and T4."
first impressions count,2,Darren Appleton,United Kingdom,18th May 2016,unverified,"Arrival into T3 at 1100 on the 12th May. Queues to pass UK/EEU border control post horrendous - took 45mins. Queues for NON-EU 4 x worse/slower and probably took hours for those people. What a great welcome to London, first impressions count. Hundreds queuing in hap-hazzard lines, purple jacked airport staff doing nothing to assist/direct travellers to appropriate lines. Speaking of which, barriers are used to control lines, yet there were numerous lines operating in the same direction meaning multiple lines were then having to funnel into one line. A blatently obvious error because someone hadn't bothered to adjust the elasticated straps on the poles to form proper directional lines. Additional staff in red uniforms situated just in front of border control posts at the front of the pax queue doing absolutely nothing. What are they there for? Border control posts - clearly not enough open and plenty of UKBF staff looking on chatting. Airports are not shopping centres. It's a shame that LHR is only interesting in profiteering through rent from retailers. Another KPI in which LHR has failed."
security is understaff and unhelpful,1,Khalid Saleem,United States,12th May 2016,unverified,London Heathrow security is understaff and unhelpful. It took 1h 20m to check my bag which was in a queue with 4 bags. Staff laughing with each other and checking each bag like they have all the time in the world. They don't care your flight is about to leave. They did not find any thing in the bag other than a toothpaste which had fallen out of my plastic bag and this took 1h 20m - I barely made it to the gate.
utterly shambolic,2,Neil McCallum,United Kingdom,10th May 2016,unverified,"Utterly shambolic is the only way to describe this evening in terminal 5 passport control. Massive queues, no air conditioning, virtually no border force desks manned, electronic gates that have an inbuilt 30 second lag after a passenger has exited before the next is allowed through. All made worse by large volumes of purple jacketed jobsworths treating everyone like small children but doing nothing of any discernible use except make things worse. It's quite clear that passenger comfort and over efficiency has been sacrificed to save money and that whoever is in charge of the whole mess couldn't manage their way out of a paper bag. My suggestion-retrain the pointless purple jackets to operate the passport desks and open more than the 4 that were open this evening. Oh and persuade the half dozen border force personnel who were standing around gossiping on the other side of passport control to get behind a desk and do their job."
extremely long queues,6,Michelle Keene,United Kingdom,29th April 2016,unverified,It is very disappointing as a British passport holder to get of a long haul flight at Heathrow and have to face extremely long queues to clear passport control. Whilst fully understanding and supporting our need for border control there is only one answer. To see so many empty and unmanned passport border desks it is clear that more staff would be the answer to make coming home a more welcoming process.
has excellent shopping,8,Albert Wong,China,21st April 2016,unverified,"LHR is the airport that I use up to 15 times a year. Such a large airport should be viewed as three airports, each served by a different tube station, and standard varies. The oldest, Terminal 1, 2 and 3, is old and in real need of renovation, even some redesign. The second, Terminal 4, is actually the most convenient, being not too large, and easy access to tube station is the key. Terminal 5 used mainly by BA is modern, and has excellent shopping and eating facilities. There are good lounges too (if you use BA, then note that the B Gate Lounge is much better than the A Gate North and South lounges). The convenient connection from LHR to every part of London is the key, and there are various means that gets you to your final destination in town. One complaint: they never give the gate number until about one hour before flight, and it can prove difficult to commute in such a large airport entailing a long walk or internal train transport. Wonder why they can't announce the gate number early, as most other airports do. This is its minus point."
first impression is not pleasant,4,Cherry Jackson,United Kingdom,20th April 2016,unverified,After travelling from Seattle to Manchester this morning I was struck at the aggressive rudeness and arrogant attitude of all the security staff at Heathrow Terminal 5. While I realise that security must be absolutely paramount - the general attitude of staff was not good. Heathrow is supposed to be the gateway to Britain and the first impression of our country at Heathrow is not a pleasant one. I was quite ashamed. I can only say that the way the staff spoke to an elderly gentleman in front of me was bordering on bullying and unpleasant. People pay an awful lot of money for the privilege of flying through Heathrow and while they definitely need security they are also due respect.
had no staff,1,Gary Barnes,Netherlands,15th April 2016,unverified,"More than an hour to get through UK/EU passport control. I wouldn't really mind if it looked like the staff were working flat out to ameliorate the wait, but at least half of the counters had no staff, whereas some had two people sitting together having a laugh. Last time I'll fly into London through Heathrow."
more staff intervention than ever,3,Kenneth Riley,United Kingdom,11th April 2016,unverified,"We had checked in online for our flight from Heathrow, and just needed our bag tags from the self-check-in machine at Terminal 2. We introduced our passports to the machine and zilch. An assistant told us we were doing it wrongly - she put our passports in and zilch. To cut a long story short, the reason it wouldn't work was because there was more than one Singapore flight and machine couldn't ascertain which one we were on. Now, I may be missing something here, but if putting your passport in the means the system has verified that you are legitimately on a flight that day, then how can it not know which one? It's supposed to be DIY, but needs more staff intervention than ever. It's pathetic given they had all that experience from Terminal 5 to go on."
more seating needs to be offered,8,A Chinnery,United Kingdom,10th April 2016,unverified,"Travelled on British Airways through Terminal 5 to Athens. On departure we arrived early and surprised to see it only took 1 hour to get there from Essex. We parked at the short stay car park which was a 5 min walk through the terminal. Security was busy (at 9am) but quick and we got through within 10 mins. There are a lot of shops and restaurants but more seating needs to be offered as the only seats are really at the gates and you don't know when a flight will leave from there. The gate was called about 1 hour before our flight and was only a couple of minutes away. Boarding was done quick and we were airborne quickly even though it was busy. On Arrival we arrived at Terminal 5b. It took roughly 15 mins to get through to Terminal 5A and passport control after touching down. We were at the car park within 45 mins of touching down. (That said out flight arrived at 22.10). No bags to pick up. Overall we would not hesitate to use Heathrow again as even though it is big and busy, it doesn't mean it is any less convenient. It is certainly better than Stansted (apart from distance) and on par with Gatwick."
terrible border control process,1,S Vickers,United Kingdom,10th April 2016,unverified,Terrible border control process. Huge queues for UK/EU passports but empty queue for others. Lots of staff hanging about but not actually doing anything useful to help to reduce queuing chaos. Disabled vehicles barging through queues posing a safety hazard to small children. Thought the US immigration was bad but this was far worse.
car park is dysfunctional,1,Frank Bower,United Kingdom,7th April 2016,unverified,"Heathrow Terminal 4 short stay car park is a dysfunctional place. After queuing for 20 minutes just to pull the ticket and enter, the day-glow brigade directs you in the wrong direction down one-way aisles and ramps. People are grimacing at you from their vehicles, honking their horns. The arrivals section is a veritable ""ant-hill"" of relatives, friends and card-wielding valets. When you want to leave (by vehicle) after paying almost £5 for a 15 minute stay, you can join the stationary queue to the exit. It took close enough to 45 minutes just to exit - is anyone responsible for this I ask?"
lack of staff in passport control,1,Chris Bowes,United Kingdom,7th April 2016,unverified,"Appalling lack of border staff in passport control on arrival at Heathrow. Only 6 staff for UK/EU arrivals. 2 doing nothing, 2 chatting, 2 dealing with arrivals. They also let non-EU passport holders go through EU positions. As a result very long queue - it took 40 minutes to get back into the country after a long flight."
enough options for eating,9,Priya Parul,India,6th April 2016,unverified,We flew in and out of Heathrow Terminal 4. It was well-marked and accessible. It did not seem crowded but perhaps during the peak season it is. There were more than enough options for eating and shopping at the airport. Complimentary WiFi available for which you will have to create an account. Be prepared for a lot of walking.
a really difficult journey,1,Keith Hamilton,United Kingdom,29th March 2016,unverified,"We were two elderly couples travelling into London Heathrow from Luxor on Monday 28th March 2016. We needed to transit from terminal 2 to terminal 5 for our flight home to Newcastle. Due to hurricane Katie our flight into Heathrow was very delayed in arrival and we were unlikely to reach the British Airways desk in time for check in. On exiting our aeroplane at terminal 2 we asked for help from an airport attendant who recommended that we proceed to baggage collection and speak to a representative at an information desk. It was impossible to identify any information desks where we could ask for the British Airways departure desk to be informed of our unavoidable delay. We had no option but to proceed as rapidly as possible to terminal 5. It was a really difficult journey pulling heavy cases, and as you must know it can be a struggle to find room in the lifts when using the Heathrow Express. We were exhausted and use of an information desk was really essential to assist us."
great kids play area,10,L Weaver,Canada,29th March 2016,unverified,London Heathrow Terminal 2 has a great kids play area. I hate when airports put up a TV and call it a play area (as watching TV is the last thing I need my kids doing before I board a 9 hour flight). Heathrow has done a great job in providing a safe area that kids can run (or crawl).
not enough seats,6,Gregory Martinez,United Kingdom,26th March 2016,unverified,"I had a transit from Terminal 3 to 5. It was a Sunday morning and the queue for the transit bus took over half an hour. Once at T5 we then had to wait another 30 minutes to get through security. Terminal 5 looks like a shopping mall attached to an airport. There were just not enough seats for the amount of passengers. If I was being cynical, I would think that this is what the management wants. They want passengers up and spending money. I found the seats to be not very comfortable and less uncomfortable the longer you sat on it. There are the usual shops and (so called) Duty free. I didn't find the prices particularly cheap and how overpriced is the chocolate? I really wasn't overly impressed with the transit or the terminal. It's more about getting people to spend money and not about passenger comfort."
long queue at immigration,3,J Tung,United Kingdom,22nd March 2016,unverified,"Used Heathrow T4 both for departure and arrival in March. Departed late morning from T4 was fairly smooth. We checked in early and didn't encountered queues, security was not busy and was efficient. There are enough shops and duty free. Used the Plaza Lounge which was ok. There is a nice viewing deck that was directly by the runway with good view of Heathrow. Arrival was another story, early morning from Asia and a tremendous long queue at immigration. There was no queue for EU/UK and the e-gate hasn't been installed. We stood in the queue for more than 30-40 minutes and noticed only half of the counters were opened. After the time waiting we were surprised that luggage was yet to arrive. I normally use T2/5 and occasionally T3 which are all fine. "
requires a lot of walking,2,Rich Jenkins,United States,21st March 2016,unverified,"I transited Heathrow twice on a trip between IAD and Vienna. The trip involved going from T5 to T3 on one leg and the reverse on my return to the US. One walks through endless, unmarked hallways on arrival and then the need to switch terminals involves a long bus ride. There is no gate information, only terminal info, which is a problem for T5 which has 3 concourses. The signage varies between useful and misleading. The layout for the concourses in on the upper level show the layout for the lower level and signage is inconsistent for finding the concourses that require transit. The gate areas in T3 are adequate, while in the newer T5 the waiting area was inadequate for the A380 and BA's boarding procedure was chaotic. The departure display was never changed and there was an absence of regular updates. Somehow BA boards more efficiently and provides better information at IAD, which is no one's idea of a great airport. There were no charging stations and the nearest one served a bullpen of at least 6 gates. The gate area was cramped in part because a Starbucks took up space that should have been reserved for waiting passengers. BA provides only cryptic information about the airport in its magazine. Passengers who change concourses have to go through security."
often misinformed statements,8,Mike Adler,United Kingdom,19th March 2016,unverified,"I do have some doubts about certain reviews. For example, in Terminal 4 most of the gates are a very short walk compared to most major airports worldwide, and another person talks about poor signage. I use each of the terminals quite regularly, and the signs inside and outside the airport are pretty good - nowhere in the world have I seen them being 100 per cent perfect, but these match and better AMS, CDG, FRA and even some Asian airports - of course better than the US where airport signs are notoriously poor. One reviewer talks about not knowing your gate until 10 mins before boarding, and I have to rubbish that as wholly inaccurate. I am not the biggest supporter of Heathrow, but I do back the 3rd runway here rather than at bucket-and-spade Gatwick, and I just feel for accuracy the reviews needs to be balanced with facts rather than what are often misinformed statements."
the experience gets worse,3,C Denson,United Kingdom,18th March 2016,unverified,"Every time I use Heathrow the experience gets worse.  Terminal 4 is starting to look old and tired. Departure was ok, if you want a shopping mall with added planes but it can be a long walk to the Gate. Arrival on March 9th was grim. A long walk from the gate to passport control. Long queues and over 30 minute wait at passport control and then a further hour's wait for bags to arrive. "
snotty inefficiency at security,3,D Wernars,United States,18th March 2016,unverified,"I traveled from Johannesburg to Heathrow - British Airways delayed our flight by 2 hours as the air conditioning in the plane was not working and they needed time to cool the aircraft. I was concerned about the 2 hour delay as I anticipated the usual anxiety causing mayhem once at Heathrow as I would have to dash to catch my connecting flight to the USA. I was not wrong. Arrived at T5, then a train and a bus stampede to get to T3. Checking in at American Airlines was ridiculous. There were only 2 women serving a long line of customers. I was questioned as to what I planned to do in America. I have an American passport so excuse my surprise at this question. Then the dreaded security. I just hate going through T3 security specifically. I make sure I carry very little of the 'banned' items just to be able to get through without incident. Not this time. My hand luggage was pulled for secondary checks. There was 1 person manning this activity and he was mouthing off the whole way through. When I pointed out that I risk missing my flight, I got a loud lecture about how he was the only one working and that everyone there had a flight to catch. He suggested I go and beg for help at a little office in the corner. I did this and one woman reluctantly plodded through and started searching my bag. Nothing was found. One women who was trying to get to the same flight as I was, was willing to leave everything there just to catch her flight. One would expect Heathrow to have sterling service considering the size of the airport and volume of customers. I understand the restrictions and I applaud that safety is an issue, but do they have to do that with bad attitudes because they don't know how to organize their staff? I usually go for a long layover at Heathrow so I don't have to endure the snotty inefficiency at the security sections. I thought 5 hours would be enough this time - I was wrong. Shopping is pretty dismal too - I don't understand all those empty designer stores. Why not cater for ordinary people with ordinary budgets? The only restaurant worth dropping money on is Gordon Ramsey's restaurant on T5. The rest are just expensive and horrible."
the place was a maze,6,N Wilson,United States,17th March 2016,unverified,"Upon arrival I was looking for special assistance that was arranged due to a head injury and I was told to go to the first person outside of the gate, I did and the woman directed me to the person next to her, which directed me to the person next to her as well, and onto the third person who then directed me to a golf cart that beeped incessantly. He seemed apathetic and ignored me most of the time. Eventually he picked up a friend of his and they watched odd videos on the elevator, but also spoke with offensive language. I did get where I needed to go though, and I felt rather foolish going through getting my visa stamped. Understandably the person there was probably tired of his job, and just glared at me and sloppily stamped and didn't have a lot of patience for me gathering my documents together to move onto the next person, and there wasn't a large line. The airport itself, I would have gotten lost in, there was signage, but it was confusing and the place was a maze, although what else would one suspect with such a large airport? I was guided to the area where my flight would be, even though the information was not on the sign yet, which was helpful. The wifi was easy to connect to and there plenty of options for food. The bathrooms though, smelt filthy and were not the cleanest. There was litter all over too."
most chaotic airport,1,Trent Lotta,United States,16th March 2016,unverified,"This is one of the most chaotic airports. The signage is next to none, you rely on courtesy stewards who are informed and available. You might have no clue where you are emplaning until the last ten minutes and then it's a mad dash to your gate. (Better hope the tram is working). I came in from Athens on a Sunday night and there were three immigration people. Took one hour in line to get through. Very pleasant immigration officer, though I must say. "
a good experience,10,A Poole,United Kingdom,10th March 2016,unverified,"I flew out from T5 on a BA flight in economy. All airline agents and airport staff were professional and it took only a few minutes to clear security. On my return I waited for about 10 minutes for my bag in the baggage hall, so no issues there either. The terminal was quite busy and overcrowded and there were some queues at the washrooms, but overall it was a good experience."
very friendly staff,8,Connor Sadler,United Kingdom,8th March 2016,unverified,"I connected through Heathrow's T5 - home of British Airways - in April. I connected from a domestic UK Flight to an International US flight. Upon arrival, we had to use air stairs and a bus. Due to a tight connection of only one hour, we received an ""Express Connect"" slip from some very friendly staff. I'm not sure what this slip does. We followed the clear signage to the Transit Hallway, we were going from T5A to T5C. Despite the mass of walking, we chose the hallway because the transit train was very busy. There was a good choice of shops and restaurants and the restrooms were very pleasing. We boarded on time with nice gate agents who assisted us onto our A380 flight to Washington Dulles. Definitely connecting through here again."
very well signed,9,Klaus Malling Olsen,Denmark,7th March 2016,unverified,"As the flight ACC-LHR was slightly delayed, I missed my connection flight, but I was already informed of this on the flight, and my seat was rebooked to the next flight leaving just two hours after the intended, so no problems, and a very smooth and quick handling by the BA staff. LHR is huge, and transfer between terminals time consuming. E.g. transfer between Terminal 3 and 5 took about 1.5 hours including security check. However, the airport is very well signed with purple signs indicating routes, and bus service between terminals goes on each 3-5 minute. If you are an experienced traveller, LHR will cause you no problems, however, first-time travellers will find LHR enormous, albeit not chaotic. Many shops and restaurants in the terminal areas, even lower cost fast-food spots. Despite its size, LHR works well each time I have ben here."
BA ridiculously short connections,4,Kevin Murphy-Steele,United Kingdom,7th March 2016,unverified,"On outbound flight the ability to fly in from an Edinburgh  shuttle and go back upstairs to catch the next flight is pretty good. The trouble is that BA often schedules you on a short connection, so there is little time to enjoy the shops and restaurants. Most long haul flights go from the two satellite terminals 5B and 5C accessed by the underground monorail, which have a fairly sparse selection of shops. But despite all this I've had many bad experiences at immigration and security it's hard to dismiss it as one bad experience. First of all the ludicrous arrangements for flight connections - it is all too easy to go through the wrong immigration line and end up exiting to arrivals accidentally when you really wanted to go back upstairs to connect to the next flight. Immigration is a disaster due to BA assigning ridiculously short connections. People are called out from the passport control queues and physically moved to the front in a rather haphazard manner. Except nobody told UK Border Control who don't have enough desks in operation to accommodate the numbers of passengers to be processed. Why exactly do incoming transiting passengers have to go through security a second time, when they did so at their origin? Especially those (like me) who arrived via the ultra-strict USA airports. Would be OK if it actually worked efficiently. Firstly there is the so-called ""Fast Track"" line which is anything but because it only brings you into the massive bottleneck sooner (and it isn't really policed by anyone, incidentally, so any Tom, Dick or Harry can blag his way onto it and not be stopped....), and then the fancy automated X-ray machines. On no less than THREE occasions now I have had my Duty Free purchases automatically singled out and put in a queue to be scanned. Alright if they were quick and efficient about doing it, but on this occasion I stood and waited 15 mins whilst the staff  messed about; pre-occupied with arguing with irate and (understandably) frustrated passengers trying to make those ridiculously tight connections. There was no sense of urgency amongst the staff - I could only forlornly look at my stuff sitting in a tray alongside several others. One other couple in front of us had theirs confiscated because the bag had not been sealed properly at their origin and they proceeded to have a heated argument with the supervisor.  For somewhere that self-styles itself to be one of the world's premier hub airports this is nothing less than shocking. "
no unnecessary waiting,10,Bruno Habus,Croatia,2nd March 2016,unverified,"I was flying to and from Heathrow terminal 2. Terminal is new and excellent. There are lots of self check-in counters, as well as the regular check in desks. Waiting time was about 10 minutes, probably because my check-in time was around 5 in the morning. Going through security was as smooth as possible, polite staff and no unnecessary waiting. Departure lounge is amazing, with lots of shops, restaurants etc. I had to wait for two hours for my flight but that wasn't a problem at all. Flight was delayed for 20 mins, but due to heavy rain so no problems at all. Boarding was smooth and fast, and finally, only five minutes waiting time for take off. "
placed in cold passage ways,1,George William Ellis,United Kingdom,23rd February 2016,unverified,"On arriving at Heathrow after a thirty hour journey, I fully understand that having to use a wheelchair I do have to leave the plane last. On leaving the plane I was shocked that I had to vacate the chair four times between the plane and the baggage area. I was placed in cold passage ways with no access to toilets or near any drinks facilities. Very few of the staff transporting me could not or did not want to speak English, and showed any interest in their job. On reaching the baggage at last, only to find our taxi driver was not there. On phoning his base in Louth (Lincs) we found him on his way back to the pickup area having been to one of the offices to ask them to tannoy for us. This they refused even after he told them that he had been waiting two hours and that one of his passengers was an eighty two year old gentleman in a wheelchair. This being the second time that my wife who is seventy eight years old and myself have been treated this way at Heathrow we will in future be looking elsware to find an airport to depart and return to from the UK. Since retirement we have been very lucky to be able to travel through many of the worlds airports, but feel we must state that Heathrow is the pits as far as wheelchair movement is handled."
top of my list,10,Aeron Aquino,United Kingdom,20th February 2016,unverified,"Heathrow is top of my list. You can never go wrong. From transport links, to the airlines that fly in and out, facilities and staff, everything is amazing! The airport lounges are also very good, truly world class. Security is tight - which is a good thing. I can never think of a negative thing about this airport."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Paul Citulski,United Kingdom,19th February 2016,unverified,"Terrible when it comes to customs to enter the UK. Long queues, little staff on desks and more walking around doing nothing or very little. After a 13 hour flight I don't want to be waiting for another hour to get through passport control. Electronic system does not work effectively. "
ground transportation is a hassle,7,Dennis Vogt,Netherlands,11th February 2016,unverified,"London Heathrow Terminal 4 gives mixed feelings. On the arrival, you can clearly see the current refurbishment efforts on-going. Immigration for EU citizens is swift, at the time (09FEB), the automatic passport gates were being renewed and all people had to be manually checked. Luggage delivery is quick in comparison to other airports, only thing is that the luggage loaders do not seem to know what priority tags are and how these should be handled. This is my fifth arrival in LHR T4 in the past year, that the priority tagged luggage is always delivered last. Onwards connections to ground transportation is a hassle - you really see and feel that T4 is no longer a focus for the airport operators. You have to go to either T5 or LHR central to be able to connect to most ground transportation  e.g. Heathrow Connect and Express services - it adds a significant delay and so far away from seamless intermodal travel. Departure at T4 is a quite efficient, being SkyTeam Elite+ member, the SkyPriority Check-in is swift and generally staffed by very helpful and friendly staff. The FastTrack sometimes can backfire on you, in particular in the evening peak. For the smokers T4 has an airside smoking facility, it is located opposite Gate 6.."
this airport is a rip-off,1,Sergio Rodriguez,Spain,6th February 2016,unverified,"As almost everything in UK, this airport is a rip-off. Only overpriced or fast-food in plastic containers options for lunch. The airport is more like a big mall rather than an airport. Signs are contradictory, sometimes guiding you to nowhere. Rude employees ignoring my family when they tried to communicate with them in a language other than English, then, making fun of them because they can't speak English (of course they don't know I can, but I arrived later). London Heathrow is not an international airport, compared with Seoul Incheon Airport where they help you (or try to) in many different languages."
security is the weakest element,7,John Bradley,United Kingdom,4th February 2016,unverified,"I use Heathrow twice month (sometimes more) - this is usually Terminal 2 or 4 (but occasionally 3 and 5). I generally find the experience quite agreeable for both arrival and departure. The shopping and dining options are quite good - I don't really buy duty free but for practical items (toiletries, stationary, newspapers etc) I cannot think of a time I haven't found what I was looking for. It is normally quite easy to find somewhere to sit but there is not much variation in seating styles compared to many airports and this is an area I feel they could improve passenger comfort - I wouldn't fancy spending more than a couple of hours here. Immigration is usually quick for the EU lane and most of the time I use the automated machines which now seem to be more reliable. Security is the weakest element - not so much in terms of the queues and waiting times (which I've never found bad) but more the human element which lacks any real courtesy and friendliness. The staff attitude and dialogue is typically passive aggressive - particularly towards foreigners and just generally unpleasant. The number of bags being pulled for secondary checks seems to be ever increasing and there is no consistency as to why (I use an old-fashioned razor with a detachable blade and sometimes the blade is confiscated but most of the time it isn't). There is no efficiency or urgency from staff - during my recent visit there were 6 bags waiting for secondary checks with 1 staff member doing this whilst 7 uniformed security staff stood 10 feet away chatting amongst themselves - it is infuriating. Another bug bear is the Heathrow Express mobile ticketing staff that intercept unsuspecting foreigners on arrival and sell them overpriced tickets to what must be one of the biggest transportation rip-offs in our capital city. If you are not in an urgent rush, buy your ticket at the Central Station and take the Heathrow Connect stopping service which goes every 30-minutes to Paddington and only takes about 10-minutes longer - it's about half the price. I actually think it's good you can buy tickets whilst waiting for baggage but there really should be transparency about the available options - but I guess that's not in their interests."
frustrated with the security,2,Pieter Boone,Netherlands,2nd February 2016,unverified,"I like T5, but have increasingly been frustrated with the security there. Yesterday I arrived on BA (transferring flights) at T5, it was relatively quiet and with my fast track clearance joined the dedicated queue upstairs for security screening. All passengers in that line are both eligible for fast track as well as have been cleared already at the originating airport. With about 10 or so people in front of me, it took less than 3 minutes to get to the conveyor belt to have my belongings go through screening. So far so good. Then my bag was rerouted on to a separate track for secondary screening. With about 8 bags prior to mine waiting to be checked. I then watched for almost 50 minutes, the incompetence, rude attitude and purposely slow process of each of those bags being checked by one of the security staff. As frustration grew with each of the waiting passengers - now missing connections - the attitude of this security staff member grew worse and worse. I noticed that these staff members work totally unsupervised, seem to hate their job, finding pleasure in some terribly misplaced 'power game' ruining passengers experience and disrupting travel. Needless to say that eventually everyone passed this ridiculous check without any interference since all these passengers already had been cleared previously. Everyone understands the importance of security but this is totally unacceptable, the 'do not care' attitude by both security as well as airport operator is infuriating. Today, I did have enough time to connect to my flight but anyone with less than 1H30 minutes will miss his or her connection."
whole encounter was very upsetting,5,C Brelivet,Australia,30th January 2016,unverified,"Going through security, a number of infant items were taken to be tested. Surprisingly, baby food was tested for the first time. An aspect that we had not encountered before. During the time we had to wait for the testing, the process was very slow and the attitudes reflected by testing staff was surprisingly and shockingly rude. We were quite upset at the attitude encountered especially as we did not provoke it. As expected, the tested items passed all tests. Later on we unfortunately discovered that lids were not secured properly which wasted both medicine for our baby as well as his food. The whole encounter was very upsetting for us. The staff on shift were unprofessional. Travelling with children is challenging enough without having to encounter such behaviour. "
staff were very friendly,7,James Nathaniel,United Kingdom,28th January 2016,unverified,"So back in March 2015, I travelled to Sydney on a return flight. Arrived at Terminal 2, we managed to check in straight away with no problems. The staff were very friendly and helped us find the gate and gave us directions. The airport was clean and there were lots of restaurants. I have been to Terminal 5 as well and they are both clean. I really like coming to this airport. Will recommend."
assistance passengers had to sit waiting,4,K Lugg,United Kingdom,20th January 2016,unverified,"We arrived bang on schedule at 5.30am in T5. All the assistance passengers had to sit waiting once we were off the plane, in an unheated area for absolutely ages. The member of staff who was there looked as if she didn't care less. When a lady next to me complained she shrugged and said she had phoned, and what more could she do. In fact, 5 of the passengers missed their connecting flights because the assistance staff were so disorganised. The British Airways staff who got off the plane were very apologetic but of course it was not their fault. Eventually we were fetched and ferried to A gates and made to wait again. I was eventually taken to the assistance waiting area at 7.45am. They fetched me and took me to my gate in good time. The folks who did the ferrying around were lovely and helpful but there is clearly a management issue here. Food and drinks are very expensive, but no more than other airports who take advantage of travellers. The shopping seemed far too expensive for me even to venture into some of the stores."
plenty of eating options,8,Nicolaas Brandts,Netherlands,12th January 2016,unverified,"I arrived with BA on January 4 at Terminal 5. I had to transfer to Terminal 4 with a bus connection. At Terminal 4 which is used by Qatar Airways for my onward flight to DOH. Everything went well and smoothly, but I guess it had to do with the fact that I arrived at a less busy moment. Nice staff at passport/luggage checkpoint and plenty of eating options although expensive."
unable to cope with volume of passengers,2,P Prendergast,United Kingdom,11th January 2016,unverified,"Arrived at London Heathrow following an overnight flight from Hanoi morning of the 10 January. As usual, the plane arrived over London in plenty of time to land, but was then placed in holding pattern for ages. We finally touched down at 7.30am and disembarked relatively efficiently. Then the fun started. First of all, UK Border control was evidently unable to cope with volume of arriving passengers. The Stasi-like airport staff barked orders at the arriving passengers. Someone was informed not to take pictures of the queue - never mind the fact that the pictures were being taken in the hall leading into the passport control area and not in the hall itself - because the queue seemed to snake about 100 metres outside the hall. When passengers finally arrived in the hall, half the automated gates seemed to be giving trouble. A couple of passport control officers were having a nice chat between themselves (at desks 1 and 2) as they evidently couldn't be bothered trying to help pick up some of the slack. After getting through UK Border Control, it took another 45 minutes before our bags arrived. Honestly. What a screw-up airport."
not a positive start,4,J Coleman,New Zealand,10th January 2016,unverified,"Flew Heathrow to Auckland, via Zurich and Shanghai. Overall, Heathrow is great for its airside services and comparatively quick and friendly security process. Check in, however, is not so great. First, we were ushered towards the self service check in machines. We told the assistant that these generally hadn't worked on our long haul trips, but he insisted on trying. Sure enough, it didn't work, but the assistant said he'd try another couple of times as [the assistants] get into trouble with the airlines if passengers do not use the self service machines. It was only when the machine refused to work and we told him to give us our passports that he gave up and just walked away from us. We ended up at a desk. The lady we went to did not greet us kindly and frankly looked miserable. She told us our check in had been partially completed and had been done incorrectly. She said 'this is actually the business class desk, but I'll do it for you anyway.' (It's worth noting this was 6am, there were hardly any other other passengers around and no other desks open for our flight). When we mentioned our issues with the machines, she told us that's not her problem. She again said that the assistants at the self service check in machines are told by the airlines/airport to ensure people avoid the check in desks. She also told us that the machines are not set properly by the airlines to work on our kind of travel. Overall, not a positive start to a long trip."
what a mishmash,4,E Thomson,United Kingdom,6th January 2016,unverified,"A long haul return trip which involved 3 international airports and 1 domestic, guess which one gets the thumbs down. For many years LHR has been a misery through which to travel. Trying to negotiate it is like rummaging in the Christmas sales and best avoided. T5, oh my word, what a mishmash. Arriving by bus from T2 on the ground floor, we had to make our way to the top floor. There is nothing warm about the décor with its display of the nuts and bolts that keep the building up. I recall the old Terminal 1 and this isn't much of an improvement. Upon arrival at the top of the escalator, a check on the flights board to determine where we should go for some assistance on our airline, then a look around at the myriad drop off points and signs which are strewn through the middle of the hall which completely obliterate the view of anything else which might be useful. That meant we dealt with a person who had a sign above her head which said ""Assistance"" when we would have been better and probably quicker at a more appropriate desk. We had been unable to check in online the night before at LAX for some unknown reason and she dealt with that part of the problem, but, could not resolve our major complaint and we had to go to desks at the far side of the hall which were fairly well obscured from view. At least the person there dealt relatively quickly and easily with our issue. This terminal and probably all of LHR needs a simplification of signage. Even fully awake, airports can be difficult to navigate, but, tired passengers don't appreciate being assailed with arrays of signage. The T5 BA Business Lounge (domestic) is shabby to say the least. The terminal itself didn't look as though there was much seating, although we were too busy trying to sort out problems to notice much, and Zone A looked very crowded. The worst thing about LHR is staff attitude. The first thing they need to realise is that airports are there for the travellers. Even when smiling at you, the attitude seems to go from condescending to surly to couldn't care less with few, but, very welcome, exceptions. Listening to what customers actually say would be helpful. Too big, too muddled, unwelcoming. Would prefer to avoid if at all possible."
problem is the staff,3,I McIntosh,United Kingdom,6th January 2016,unverified,"The biggest problem is the staff. No doubt the terminal is modern and clean etc but people make the difference. Passport control was slow: one person for our long queue. Fast track was signposted but anyone and everyone was going down it. And then our shopping bought in Dallas airport was ""snatched"" because it wasn't in the right bag. Sanctuary was finally reached at the BA lounge."
security was reasonably efficient,9,James Corbett,United Kingdom,6th January 2016,unverified,"I use T5 whenever I can, most recently on a JFK-bound flight over the Christmas period. Terminal 5 was once again clean, very well-equipped for shopping and restaurants, and well sign-posted. Security was reasonably efficient, and arriving back from JFK T7 on 28 December was (by comparison) a dream - straight through the electronic passport gates, with minimal queuing. Access to the car park is simple, and the terminal is well-served with the Heathrow Express."
really magnificent airport,10,G Brambilla,United Kingdom,5th January 2016,unverified,"I flew from terminal 2 and in my opinion this is the best terminal I have come across in the whole world. Bright and airy, with fast check in, security check and a nice choice of shops. All gates are reasonably close to the shopping area and there is a nice play area for kids, subdivided by age and supervised. I used Lufthansa lounge, which I regard as extraordinary. there is a subterranean connection to the bus station, the other terminals and to the underground service to central London. A really magnificent airport."
difficult going through,4,Gareth McShea,Australia,2nd January 2016,unverified,"Heathrow has great options for food and shopping, but falls behind on efficiency and security. Friendly staff, but they just don't seem to get it. Every time I go through LHR I have to show my passport and/or tickets at least three times and this is generally to catch a flight to another UK airport. On my last trip through the airport we had to get to T1 from T3. After taking a bus to T1 we proceeded to the gate as displayed. However, between looking at the screen and completing our long walk to the gate, we discovered it had been changed. This meant we had to run to the opposite end of the terminal. We were lucky that our next flight was delayed or we may have missed it. Furthermore, we were held up at security where the staff were slow and relaxed and seemed more interested in having a chat with us than getting us through as quick as possible. They also deemed it necessary to remove my newly purchased aftershave from duty free in Hong Kong from its packaging. Everything seems difficult going through LHR."
a superb terminal,6,Ray Thomas,United Kingdom,30th December 2015,unverified,"Terminal 5 is a superb terminal but two suggestions - could BAA please have an arrivals board the same size lettering as Kings Cross, Euston etc and not the tiddly letters at Terminal 5 that can only be read 1m away. Secondly it is very arrogant of BA only to have Club or First Class lounges, who can afford these unless they are business and live on a plane, other terminals are very well served."
through security within 10 minutes,10,Paul Ginnifer,United Kingdom,26th December 2015,unverified,Dropped of at terminal 3 outside of terminal entrance at 12 noon for a 2.35 flight. Easy check in. Got through security within 10 minutes and had a nice meal and a drink in the terminal. Called to gate 10 minute walk and boarded. Was really easy no hassle at all apart from W H Smiths insisting on boarding card. Landed back from JFK at 7.00 am and was sat in my car in off site Car park an hour later. Everything worked smoothly and quickly. Even to the extent of being first in line at passport control for a new gate to open. I literally waited 30 seconds. So so easy. I'm flying from terminal 4 soon hope it goes so easy.
it was pure chaos,4,Timothy Thilthorpe,Australia,14th December 2015,unverified,"Because of circumstances beyond our control, we flew on the 4th of December from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, Business Class with Lufthansa on flight LH901 departing at 9.30am. We arrived in plenty of time for our flight, I had checked in online the night before and all I had to do was print off my boarding pass at the airport. No problem. My partner recently had a knee replacement so I requested an assisted flight. We arrived at check-in, gave up our baggage and the lady politeley directed us to the counter for assisted flights. The only thing is can say is, it was pure chaos. The young lady, who seemed to be in charge, had no customer service skills at all. After approx. 30 minutes we were finally taken to Lufthansa's Business Class Lounge. I had the distinct impression the people there were just glad to be rid of another troublesome customer. In contrast the young man that came and picked up my partner to take her to the flight was both charming and very helpful. As this was our first, and now I hope our last, experience flying to and from London Heathrow it did not make a very favourable impression. A very disappointed customer. "
very few wheelchairs available,3,Connie Colman,United Kingdom,10th December 2015,unverified,I arrived after 23 hours in the air on a flight from Australia by which time I was pretty exhausted and anxious to get home. I needed assistance in the form of a wheelchair - that was when all the delays / difficulties began - very few wheelchairs available and then a long wait for a buggy to take passengers to the immigration hall where there was yet another delay. Foreign passengers who had been issued with landing passes which had to be filled in had to be helped to fill them in (why not done with help from flight atendants before touchdown?) Progress thereafter was reasonably speedy and the staff member pushing my wheelchair went the extra mile to get me through to arrivals where my taxidriver was waiting. I might add that to add to my frustration I was charged extra because of the delay caused by inefficient planning in supplying wheelchairs etc.
staff were surly and officious,1,G MacKay,United Kingdom,2nd December 2015,unverified,Boarding pass had to be presented at four separate points for a simple internal flight. Far too many staff were surly and officious. What a difference from our treatment as foreigners at JFK where staff were polite and procedures speedy. An awful welcome back to the UK.
pleasantly surprised with T4,9,Dominic Grundy,Australia,27th November 2015,unverified,Pleasantly surprised with Terminal 4 at London Heathrow Airport. Arrived the recommended 3 Hours before departure and breezed through check in and security. Terminal is spacious and has good selection of shops and eatery's airside. Also found WiFi easy to connect and fast. Probably only downside were security staff who all looked miserable. 
food outlets are plenty,9,Kuhan Kandiah Chelvanathan ,Malaysia,25th November 2015,unverified,"I always enjoy my travels to London Heathrow through Terminal 4. The terminal is not a very busy terminal in the wee hours of the morning with the first few arrivals from the Far and  Middle East (KUL, DOH, CMB, BWN and etc). Food outlets are plenty and toilets scattered all around the transit and terminal areas. The only setback is it requires more time for connecting flights through other terminals via a shuttle service. Overall an interesting experience through Terminal 4 at LHR."
never experienced such hostility,1,C Hughes,United Kingdom,23rd November 2015,unverified,"My second visit to Heathrow Terminal 5 - I have never experienced such hostility from security staff in over 40 yrs of travel. My mistake was not realising that duty free liquids from South Africa had to be declared as I approached security. The liquids showed up on the scanner and I was told I would have to wait to have the substances checked. As my connection was leaving in an hour and there were several trays were ahead of me, I asked how long it would take and was told ""It will take as long as it takes"" and it was my own fault - the staff attitude towards me was unprofessional. My bag was subject to a vigorous inspection by another officer who proceeded to berate me for creating more work. However, staff are uncommunicative and largely ignore customers and there is nothing more frustrating than seeing people standing around chatting with colleagues instead of doing the job they are employed to do. I hope I never have to use Heathrow again and feel sorry for anybody that does."
quite airy and user friendly,9,Gary Marsh,United Kingdom,22nd November 2015,unverified,I was looking forward to flying from the new terminal as it was only opened last year. It is known as the Queens Terminal. It appears to be quite airy and user friendly with wide open spaces and does not feel claustrophobic like some airport terminals. There are plenty of check in counters and some self check in kiosks with staff on hand to assist with check in. My only gripe to be honest is that there is a hell of a trek to make before you reach the departure gates in the satellite. Fast track was fairly busy but the queues were not too long and we were airside within about ten minutes. There are plenty of shops airside if you wanted to make some extra purchases before you flight. There are also plenty of eateries but as with most airports it is quite pricey to eat there.
a glorified shopping mall,3,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,22nd November 2015,unverified,"Heathrow T3 to Miami 1st November. Whilst Terminal 5 is still a joy to depart from, Terminal 3 became nothing more than a glorified shopping mall years ago. And a very overpriced one at that - there isn't much that is 'duty free' about it. The best I can say is that our BA flight was only a few minutes late taking off (and that was due to fog), we found a seat, and the toilets and WiFi worked. A dump, if you will pardon the expression. I would recommend Heathrow but not Terminal 3. Why BA are moving some of their flights there is a complete mystery to me."
security was well organised,7,J Tung,United Kingdom,18th November 2015,unverified,"Departed from LHR T2 in October and returned in November. First time in this terminal and overall it was an ok experience. Check in for first/business/pre economy in the evening was empty and the security was well organised. There are some shops and duty free at the main terminal, not as good as T5 but sufficient if you need to kill some time. The Plaza Lounge was great - very calming with an oriental feel. So much better than the BA lounge in T5. My long haul flight departed from T2B so it was a lot of escalators up and down and long walk to the gate. It's probably the most boring walk in the airports. Gate area was well organised. Returning experience was similar to departure. A very long walk but the airport was empty. Through security in a second using e-gate. Luggage was out within 5-10 minutes of landing which was very impressive. Then another long walk to catch Heathrow express."
very modern and spacious,10,A Douas,Greece,16th November 2015,unverified,"Terminal 5 is very modern and spacious and the queues are not too long in security on departures or arrivals. Shopping is great duty free. Food could have a few more options, but it is perfectly sufficient for most people."
Heathrow is a complete jumble,3,A Warren,United Kingdom,15th November 2015,unverified,"We were very disappointed with Heathrow Terminal 3, arriving back from Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific. The truth is, Heathrow is a complete jumble. The walk to immigration from the plane took over half an hour because we can't walk so well these days and the moving walkways only go so far. The worst bit was the Long Stay Car Park bus. When we flew out, the bus driver told us to wait at stop 16. On our return, stop 16 had moved and now there were TWO buses. One for business and one for non business car parks. We had been travelling for 20 hours and got on the business bus by mistake. The driver was really very sarcastic about this. We and three other young ladies had to manhandle our cases off the bus and wait for another bus that took us to the car park. That driver needs some re-training. I think it might help if he spent some time in Australia or Hong Kong to experience how customer service should be delivered."
transport to the gates is brilliant,8,James Tapley,United Kingdom,10th November 2015,unverified,"We traveled from Heathrow Terminal 5 last year when we went to Istanbul. We walked in and went straight to the check-in, the queue didn't take too long, only around 5 to 10 minutes. We then went to customs witch was very strict but good. After that we looked around at the restaurants. The airport has places to eat or drink ranging from a Starbucks to Gordon Ramsey's terminal 5 restaurant. The transport to the gates is brilliant. There is a underground system with a few stops at areas of the terminal. When we got to our gate we all got called onboard and entered the plane calmly."
a hot shower upon arrival was amazing,9,Michael Lonergan,United States,10th November 2015,unverified,"Flying JFK - LHR and knowing that our hotel would not be ready we took advantage of the business arrival lounge. It was not that spacious but clean and welcoming. We were offered a large shower room. It was clean and well attended to. A hot shower upon arrival was amazing! Breakfast was available, but I didn't eat it. Highly recommend this!"
lacking in compassion,3,E Farr,United Kingdom,4th November 2015,unverified,"The security staff at Terminal 2 completely upset my travel experience. I was travelling for work and had two pieces of hand luggage (one small suitcase + a handbag) with two liquid bags (one in each case). I was not aware these liquid bags were limited to one per person rather than per bag and was subsequently treated like a criminal. The staff were unfriendly, totally lacking in compassion and downright rude. Fellow passengers were also shocked at my treatment and the lack of apology - the experience ruined the rest of my business trip travel."
very long walk,1,UD Dotan,Israel,3rd November 2015,unverified,Landed with the A380 from Miami and needed to get to terminal 5. One of my worst travel experience. Very long walk from the plane to the bus shuttle station. Waiting in a long queue for about 15-20 minutes in an non ventilated hall. It feels like BA retreated 20 years back with the decision to use terminal 3 for their A380 and 747 long haul flights.
we almost missed our flight,3,Lucas Lukaso ,Kenya,2nd November 2015,unverified,"Horrible experience while dropping our luggage in Terminal 2. The staff that handled our check-in could not understand that some countries around the world have handwritten and stamped resident/work permits. They were rude and didn't want to listen to what I was telling them. They spent 50 minutes asking questions (that they could have asked me) to their supervisor on phone. In the end, we almost missed our flight and lost our checked bags (We recovered them 4 days later). For Terminal 2 B gates, you will spend 15 minutes if you run they way we did before the gate closure."
very time consuming and unorganized,4,P Vadgama,United Kingdom,1st November 2015,unverified,"We had done our online check in and we got to the airport well in advance, joined the online queue which took us over 2 hours to baggage drop. This was really frustrating as there was no difference between non online check-in and online checked in. It was very time consuming and unorganized."
barring you from boarding,1,Josh Trent,United Kingdom,30th October 2015,unverified,"Am a regular traveller via T5 to Edinburgh with BA. Had noticed in the past that when the lift arrives at departures, many (what appear to be business) travellers make a mad and crazy dash for security, mowing down anyone on the top concourse who might be in their way. But it was only this evening that I realised why. I found out that T5 runs a policy of barring you from boarding your flight if you are not through security within 35 mins of your flight departing. I was at security this evening 27 mins before my flight was due to leave and was barred from getting through. Only the seasoned traveller knows of this 35 mins rule - from experience, as BA doesn't tell you (I checked my pre-flight e-mail from BA and it definitely doesn't point this out). What happens then if you are not at security within this 35mins period? Well, you are directed straight to BA's massive sales desk, located between the two security entry (or better still 'non-entry') points. Yes, you have to book a new ticket and may have to wait days for the next available flight. Nice way of getting lots of money from you for nothing. My advice: Stay away from Terminal 5. Simple reason: it's the only airport terminal anywhere where BA controls security and therefore controls the amount of time that you are forced to spend in the shopping area beyond security (minimum time that you must spend in and around the shops is 35 minutes), a retail and catering offer which is, surprise-surprise, owned by BA."
passenger-friendly and efficient,9,Anurag Dave,United States,29th October 2015,unverified,"Arrived at LHR Terminal 2 by United Airlines from LAX. There are restrooms available right after your disembark the aircraft. It is about a 5 minute walk to UK Border Control, and the signs are easy to follow. The immigration line moved slowly on Friday afternoon, but the immigration officer was very courteous. Baggage claim and currency exchange were fast. It wasn't very obvious to me how to reach ground transportation (Hoppa Bus to Hotels), but one of the airport personnel was kind enough to guide me in the right direction. After taking the elevators to the shuttle area, I had to wait a long time for the bus to my particular hotel. On my way back, check-in and security were very smooth. I couldn't believe how quickly I was able to get through all the processes and reach the boarding area. Overall, I found my departure experience at Heathrow's T2 to be passenger-friendly and efficient."
baggage claim was extremely quick,8,Andre Bouzid,United Kingdom,29th October 2015,unverified,"We arrived on BA883 from Kiev (Terminal 5) twenty minutes early and so were happy to be able to go home as we had had a long journey. As soon as we got to immigration, it was packed with teenagers who had come back from Los Angeles. They were loud and disrespectful to other passengers. It took us 45 minutes to clear immigration since only 3 booths were open. Baggage claim was extremely quick. We got out and went home promptly. Apart from the queuing, a smooth experience."
incredibly unhelpful and unwelcoming,1,Katherine Ng,United Kingdom,28th October 2015,unverified,"Airport security rude, unfriendly, unhelpful. They seem to forget that passengers travelling through this airport are paying customers. You are treated like some sort of criminal for no reason. This is no way for anyone to start a holiday. Being professional is one thing however there is no need for them to treat all passengers as cattle and criminals. I would hate to think about my relatives from America and Asia having to use this airport and the bad impression it gives of London and the UK. Also for long haul passengers like myself that also travel regularly this is a lot of money on an air ticket and would expect to be treated respectfully and kindly at the start of any holiday. On top of that the terminal is old and requires long walks to departure gates. Again not pleasant and all staff that work in this airport appear to be zombie like and incredibly unhelpful and unwelcoming. Awful training of staff and no positive management. Hate to be travelling through this terminal again."
plenty of choice for food,8,Gaspard Smith-vaniz,France,28th October 2015,unverified,"I transited through Heathrow on my way to the U.S. The transport from one terminal to the other was pretty chaotic, there weren't enough buses, and the security was slow. When I got to the waiting area I was pretty happy because there was a nice view on the planes and the other terminals, and had free wi-fi. Plenty of choice for food because there were so many restaurants and shops."
no really good food options,4,P Petrovic,Serbia,25th October 2015,unverified,"For an airport of this size and relevance Heathrow is rather underwhelming. The layout of separate terminals means that you should add a lot of extra time if you have a transfer at this airport. Connection to the city is good, but only if you have enough cash to pay for the expensive Heathrow Express. Otherwise you will be using the regular tube line where you will try to find a spot for you and your bags among commuters. The airport is well organized but there are often big queues especially at immigration so you should take that into consideration when making your plans. For the airport of this size food and shopping is very poor (except for T5 which gives a bit more options). Many of the chains have only one restaurant at one of the terminals so you might not find what you were hoping for on yours. There are no really good food options and when it comes to shopping there are only a few luxury stores plus a few stationery stores and that's it. Staff are mostly rude and tired, which is not surprising, but it is an annoyance. I think you should try one of the other airports in the city before Heathrow."
one mile long walk,3,Elena Savilo,United States,23rd October 2015,unverified,"After a smooth ride through security with a ""happy face"" rating (that is after we learned that kindles are also considered ""computers""), we had to experience the approximate one mile long walk to gate 40 in terminal number 3 to get to our departing flight to Phoenix. I'm just thinking about my poor 80 year old mother who is actually in good shape, who will have to do this in December when she will be visiting with me in Arizona. And like her, many other old people connecting from Europe or Asia. The new change effective October 14th, 2015 certainly did not make me a happy traveler with BA. And the reclining lounges on the upper floor are not even accessible to people before a 9 plus hour flight. "
what a good airport terminal should be,9,Christopher Frana,United Kingdom,22nd October 2015,unverified,"This is a review of Terminal 5. I have been let down once, buy slow security checks, but apart from that, it is a lesson in what a good airport terminal should be. Lots of space and good facilities. Well laid out and a nice place to spend time, while you wait to fly."
complete incompetence,1,U Sarid,United States,18th October 2015,unverified,The complete incompetence of whoever is in charge of ensuring some minimum number of agents to process arrivals through London Heathrow Airport immigration was matched by their marked indifference. The man in charge literally said he was too busy to talk to the hall full of passengers and explain or apologize. Took well over an hour and I arrived when the line was short. Others must have taken a couple of hours. 
long trek to your plane,5,Jeff Michel,Switzerland,10th October 2015,unverified,"Whilst the new T2 is smart and pleasant (although distinct lack of 'normal' shops), the B gates are ridiculous. To have a 20 minute walk from the terminal (including moving walkways) is just not on, with a new terminal. Half way along they even have electric buggys which people can wait for to drive them to the gates, so they are obviously aware of this major problem. Basically, as soon as the gate is shown on the departure boards, if your flight is on a B gate, forget food, shopping etc... and start the long, long trek to your plane."
politeness and common sense were absent,2,S Leahy,Canada,9th October 2015,unverified,"As an over 80 year old I was being assisted through the immigration area (along with two other women who were obviously older than me) by a very pleasant employee of Air Canada. However, I was quite shocked by the rudeness of the girl who checked our bags at immigration and who was overly intrusive emptying all our belongings out and leaving them in great disarray. She said I am just doing my job but there are ways of doing the job politely and respectfully instead of rudely and vindictively. When she saw me looking at her badge, she immediately turned it around so I could not get her name. Politeness and common sense were completely absent. There was nothing unusual in our bags. I have travelled through Heathrow every year for more than 30 years and have never met such unpleasantness before."
terminal was very quiet,9,D Whalley,United Kingdom,9th October 2015,unverified,"My first experience of the refurbished T2, and it was good. A mid-day flight in the middle of the week in October is not the busiest time to fly. The terminal was very quiet. The signage was clear with everything I needed well displayed. Very easy journey through security. Inside lounge there was plenty of seating. This is a distinct improvement on the old terminal."
I was completely disoriented,1,Chris Here,United Kingdom,9th October 2015,unverified,"I had the misfortune to catch a flight from the new Heathrow Terminal 2 recently. It's sad enough that the previous friendly smile of the EVA air checkin agents has been replaced by touchscreens, but the real horror awaits after you pass through security. There are hundreds of huge screens everywhere, with huge animated flashing adverts in your face everywhere you look. Within seconds, I was completely disoriented. Realising that I was close to having a panic attack, I managed to make my way back to security, where I spent a most miserable hour crouched on a chair almost out of sight of the dreaded screens. Even there, the harsh lighting and black surfaces are incredibly unpleasant and stressful. I must have been visibly distressed, yet the dozens of staff completely ignored me. I had intended to buy several items at the airport, but was so disoriented by the lighting and the screens, I couldn't get any of the things I wanted. I have been through hundreds of airports, and T2 is by a very long way the most ghastly, inhuman, miserable, utterly inhospitable place I have ever had the misfortune to experience. I dread the next time I have to visit this nightmare of a place."
would have missed my flight,1,Joseph Bleckman,United States,3rd October 2015,unverified,"It took longer for me to transfer flights at Heathrow than it did for me to fly there from Amsterdam. Going from one terminal to another required a short subway ride followed by a long bus ride with a more twisty and comical route than Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disneyland. If my departing plane had been on time, I would have missed my flight. The minimum amout of time suggested to transfer flights at Heathrow is a full hour and a half. I strongly suggest that you never book any travel that requires you to transfer at Heathrow."
Heathrow Airport provides nothing,1,Simon Voysey,United Kingdom,27th September 2015,unverified,"England's own Rugby World Cup, the 3rd biggest sporting event in the world and Heathrow Airport provides nothing.  No screens showing the matches outside of one pub screen. Nothing is shown at the boarding gates except BBC news. What is Heathrow Airport playing at. Rest of country enjoys this while customers at Heathrow Airport are provided nothing - an utter disgrace."
exceptional as a airport,10,E Davies,United Kingdom,27th September 2015,unverified,"Departed and arrived back through the new terminal two on a multi stop holiday across Northern America. Heathrow was exceptional as a airport. Excellent drop off and pick up. We passed quickly enough through security on a busy morning with polite staff and wonderful signage. All travellators were working making the journey to departure gate easy. On arrival we landed, stopped at very clean and tidy toilets, walked to security using e passport arrivals queue and collected our bags and had reached parking in 30 minutes. Again excellent signage and welcoming and friendly staff in the arrivals hall. Really impressed. Thank you Heathrow."
T4 Immigration was chaos,5,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,23rd September 2015,unverified,"Heathrow T4 was busy on arrival. Immigration was chaos. The queue for non EU passport holders must have had several hundred people in it.  This had a knock on effect for us as the carousel we had to collect our luggage from, had many bags off a previous flight which couldn't be collected as the passengers were stuck in immigration. This delayed us by an hour. I had to ask two staff members standing around chatting, if they could take some of the bags off so those from our flight could drop down on to the carousel. "
"a cold dark, unfriendly exhausting experience",1,Colin Denson,United Kingdom,22nd September 2015,unverified,"Departure from Terminal 2 to Vienna 6.00am departure with Austrian Airlines. Having checked in online I arrived at 4.00am to drop of luggage. None of the desks were open. Staff arrived and stood around chatting, desks were finally opened from around 4.15 onwards at a glacial pace. No smiles and minimal communication. None of the duty free shops were open and most of the other shops were closed. The walk to the gate was long and the seating area was cold. Overall, a cold dark, unfriendly exhausting experience. Arrival at Terminal 2 from Vienna - a very long taxi to the gate after touchdown. Another long, long cold walk to arrivals. The E-Passport gates in passport control kept crashing, there were lots of Border Agency staff just standing around barking at people - wouldn't they be better employed on a desk checking passports and clearing the queues? The walk from the arrivals hall to the central bus station is another long hike made worse by the fact that the signage is at best confusing and at worse just incorrect. In the end I never did find the bus station and gave up and got the tube."
I was wiped out by time I got to bus terminal,2,Joseph Reynolds,United Kingdom,21st September 2015,unverified,Distance from arrival to immigration is haunting. Just goes on and on forever. Some of the people movers not working. Immigration was okay. Not too long this time. I have been there when it was just queueing back to the gate. Distance from immigration to baggage daunting. Distance from baggage to central bus terminal a slog too. I was wiped out by time I got to bus terminal and I'm a runner.
what sort of advertisement is that for a visitor,6,N Wright,United Kingdom,21st September 2015,unverified,"On return from Oslo, before going through immigration, I popped into the Gents. With one urinal blocked, the other spilt all over the floor and the hand dryer not working, what sort of advertisement is that for a visitor to 'Great' Britain?"
no care for personal property,1,M Coleman,United States,18th September 2015,unverified,"At 67 years old with two knee replacements, pins in my back and a metal elbow I get a pat down every time I enter an airport - routine and expected. Today at Heathrow term 4 I stepped through the alarm system and announce I need a pat down at about 16.30, I was prepared for the usual drill. They put me through a full body scanner and then went to pat me down. Twice I asked that this be done in sight of my belongings - I have had things lifted at other airports. Not only did the security guard refuse to move the pat down location 2-3 feet away so I could see my things, she patted down every inch of my body at least twice and used her wand multiple times. It was as if either she was ""teaching me a lesson"" for asking to be near my things, or she actually wanted my things to sit unattended long enough to be stolen. Recently I have flown through JFK, ATL, CDG and other airports and they always allow me to stand in sight of my belongings. What's with Heathrow - you are not supposed to be treating the elderly with disrespect and no care for personal property."
"As a Brit, it's frankly embarrassing",2,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,18th September 2015,unverified,"T3 07.00 hrs. Dreadful place. 45 minute wait for Immigration with plenty of unused desks / e-passport machines evident. The queues stretched back outside the Immigration Hall. Surely Immigration can be set up to match the flow of arriving passengers? Clearly not. Despite the lengthy wait in Immigration a further 1 hour wait was required to get my bag. All in all from landing to getting out of the terminal took 2 hours. Welcome to London. I then made a bus transfer to Stanstead. The central Bus Station which was never very great is being refurbished and passengers now have to queue in a temporary area outside T3. Place is a joke. As a Brit, it's frankly embarrassing."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,A Coogans,United Kingdom,6th September 2015,unverified,"I have used Heathrow many times in recent years and although I still like T5, it seems to get busier and busier each time. I enjoy transferring from a domestic UK to an international flight there, no hassle at all. I like the opposite less. Having to go through a boarding pass check by the airline, then an immigration check by the UK Border authorities, then going through a boarding pass check by airport security even before joining the often slow line at security is extremely tedious, especially if you have arrived on a long flight. Security can sometimes be very rude too I have noticed. Recently I have had to transfer from a T5 domestic to a T3 international flight and in those cases you do have to pass through security again, even though you are only on an airport connecting bus. Getting to the security checkpoint in T3 requires a long walk up and down escalators and through deserted corridors which don't give a good impression. The gates are nicely refurbished, but the central waiting and shopping areas are busy and the low ceilings make them very dark. Hopefully if T1 reopens the pressure on space will be reduced. I would recommend Heathrow to some people and not to others, depending on the kind of connection they were making and their level of mobility."
the distance we had to walk,4,Benjamin Teece,United Kingdom,5th September 2015,unverified,"Check in at Terminal 2 Heathrow Airport was good and directions to Lounge were clear. What was a shock was the distance we had to walk going up and down steep escalators, which would be difficult for people of maturing years. There are of course lifts to use instead. There were also two travelator sections which were out of action. The worst part was to find when our luggage was unloaded at Reykjavik that suitcases was saturated and the contents wet through where they had been left out in the rain at Heathrow.  I fear that poor management shows with Terminal design. "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Mark Chisholm,United Kingdom,5th September 2015,unverified,Arrived at Heathrow Terminal 5 from Baku on the evening of 30th August to find the queue of people way past the immigration and down the walkway. After about fifteen minutes another flight arrived and they emerged from an escalator in the middle of the heaving mass to jump in front of most of us. There was one totally ineffective security  lady who just gave up trying to control the chaos. When we eventually arrived at the hall where the immigration officers were sitting we found four in place. There was about 20 electronic gates but none were switched on. Of course being British I had to use the UK/EU line which was about 50 times longer than the non-EU one. I would have cleared the line half an hour earlier if I had been a foreign national. I was pleased to see that the aircraft staff desk was manned with not one person arriving there after the first ten minutes. After about 45 mins of sitting watching the seething mass in the hall the officer manning the empty desk decided that it was all too much and left. The terminal or rather arrival gate we came into at T5 was not finished but of course T1 - the Baku flight original terminal had been closed. Prematurely it seems. Frankly Heathrow or at least T5 is a shambles and the owners and UK Government should be ashamed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Evgenia Dimova,United States,4th September 2015,unverified,"Out of all airports I've been to, Heathrow is by far the worst. Slow wifi, a labyrinth of a building, confusing signage and rarely rude information desk clerks. Security is a joke (high levels of disorganization), and, of course, no smoking lounges. Two thumbs down."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,James Myers,United Kingdom,2nd September 2015,unverified,"Flew in and out of terminal 3 at Heathrow. It is truly awful and belongs in the 1950s. The whole terminal needs rebuilding with some thought put into the design and people flows this time. The terminal is dirty. The staff are lacklustre and give the impression they can't be bothered and only turn up for the minimun wage. Waited over an hour for baggage while they kept announcing changes of belt. There are quite obviously failures in management since the whole concept of customer service is absent. Terminal 3 has seating for 5 passengers at each baggage belt (when a plane drops off 300 passengers the maths just doesn't work). The luggage trolley rack is located at the opposite end from where arrivals enter the baggage hall; a smidgen of common sense here would avoid passengers flying off in all directions, bumping into each as the get a trolley and then come back to baggage carousel to pick up delayed luggage (if they are the lucky ones). Heathrow, avoid if at all possible."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,1st September 2015,unverified,"I travel threough Heathrow on a weekly basis, mostly Terminal 5. This terminal is starting to feel and look like a Shopping Mall. There are more shops than are really needed, and for passengers less places to sit and rest before a long flight. Trying to get to the British Airways Lounges is a long walk in the opposite direction to where the actual lounges really are, this is a ploy to get passengers to walk through the shops hoping they may purchase something. "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Abhishek Singh,India,30th August 2015,unverified,"Probably the worst airport I've seen. 1) customer service at T5 is more of a suggestion. I landed at 7 am, reached the service desk at 8.15 and stood for 50 mins before someone turned up. Reason given that they are opened only if staff are there. 2) Horrible connectivity between A, B and C concourses. People running through tunnel from C to B, as there is no train service. 3) I was reading earlier reviews and couldn't find anything to do, except sit in a chair, as told by ppl giving this airport 10 4) this seems to be the only airport with smoking facilities in transit areas, so smokers beware. Don't transit through Heathrow if you need to smoke."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,ZLevenson,United Kingdom,29th August 2015,unverified,"Travelled through Terminal 3 to and from the US. Dedicated check in for Virgin and Delta passengers very modern. Security was speedy but thorough. I found the terminal layout to be very crowded. LHR has assigned more space to gates and flights at Terminal 3 than to shops and restaurants in comparison to the other terminals at Heathrow. Great selection of shops. Could be more restaurants however I was still happy. It is quite noticeable in Terminal 3 that there is a lack of windows in the shopping area. Terminal 3 size is quite deceptive, at first seeming small in comparison to the other terminals, but in fact is huge once you walk on. Signage was very good with information stands located around it. Boarding the aircraft was speedy."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Gareth Hale,United Kingdom,29th August 2015,unverified,"Heathrow airport is big but organized, great amount of restaurants, shops, transit options. The facilities are spotless, and plenty to do during the long waits. Cannot really fault it. "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,A Dernburg,United States,27th August 2015,unverified,"I was motivated to write this review after the worst travel experience I have encountered. I arrived at LHR on an overnight British Airways flight from San Francisco, and thought it would be straightforward to manage passport control in time for my connecting flight, which was scheduled to depart 2 hours later out of the same terminal (Terminal 5). Several factors conspired to make me almost miss my connecting flight: 1) Terrible signage, which led to my standing in the wrong passport control line for over 40 minutes, only to be told (upon reaching the passport control agent) that I was in the wrong line and needed to go to the ""Flight Connections"" line. 2) The control agents in the second line were very efficient, and kindly gave me a fluorescent orange ""Fast Track"" note to expedite my transit, but this may have done more harm than good, since the ""Fast Track"" security line into which I was routed was a Kafkaesque experience. All passengers were required to pass through security (again), which involved removing all gels/liquids/pastes/etc. from carry-on luggage, transferring them into a small plastic bag, removing laptops etc., and standing in a incredibly slow line to go through a metal detector. Passengers were not asked to remove their shoes, but every single passenger I saw go through the metal detector triggered the alarm, which required a) removal of said shoes to be X-rayed and b) a thorough and very slow pat-down by one of two agents (one for men, one for women), which slowed the line to a crawl. I watched over 30 minutes elapse while standing in this line (again, this was the ""Fast-Track"" line), and then my bag was flagged for random screening, requiring an additional 10+ minutes while another security agent swiped my various bags and tested them by gas chromatography. By the time I got through this process, my flight was about to close, and I had to run at full tilt to the gate, roughly a kilometer from the security checkpoint. The terminal seemed to have some nice shops, restaurants, and other amenities, but I was unable to appreciate them while running at top speed from the security line to my gate."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Vincent Doran,United States,27th August 2015,unverified,"The worse transit experience in my life. I've been through 100s of airports throughout the world, and Heathrow over 40 times. Aside for having to walk over a mile to transfer from gate to gate (and in the event arriving in another terminal from which your board your connecting flight taking an extended bus trip), going through security has become a nightmare. We had to do it twice both on our way to India and returning to the States. In both instances understaffed check points and truly bazaar search habits lead to extended delays. Our return trip we went through security checks in Mumbai, Delhi, Paris with no concerns or questions. We never left any airport - yet at Heathrow it took over 1 hour as the chap checked every small bottle, my wife's jewelry and other non-liquid items. No amount of complaining to a ""supervisor"" was effective as he said, there were new procedures for the UK. Well the UK won't see me again as it was truly a nightmare for two 60 year old individuals. Oh, and a tip for US citizens, the UK considers meds part of your one plastic bag (and make sure you carry the doctor's script). "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,A Monaghan,United Kingdom,26th August 2015,unverified,"On my recent trip to Cologne, I was lucky enough to fly out of and in to Heathrow Terminal 2. The terminal was clean and easy to get around, and the staff were friendly and helpful. Whilst the terminal was busy, I was able to find a comfortable place to sit, and I was served very quickly in the Leon they have. The range of shops that are present in T2 are pleasant and wide, and it reminded me just how much I love flying out of Heathrow. I have also recently flown out of T5 to America. This was also very pleasant, and I do not agree with the other reviews - I found the security staff quick and polite. Heathrow Airport is the finest airport in the UK, in my opinion."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Catherine Short,United Kingdom,24th August 2015,unverified,"Would agree with the review submitted by W Johnson 14/08/2015 my husband and I were travelling through T5 and at security the female tray handler was rude and condescending obviousley chosen the wrong career I wonder if it was the same member of staff. I did comment to another member of staff who thought she was maybe ""having a bad day"". Well we all have bad days now and again but when we come to work we leave the bad days at home. It was a pity as it creates a bad impression to passengers who use the airport."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Ed Roggeveen,New Zealand,23rd August 2015,unverified,"We flew in from Frankfurt and had 6 and a bit hours before heading back to Auckland. We had no trouble at all finding our way on foot from Terminal 2 to 3 and we headed through security for the Family Lounge. This was brilliant. Our 4 year old son had a great time here and the two ladies running it were fantastic. If you are travelling with a young child then this is where to go. Dinner options in this area were pretty good, although all a bit pricey. Only criticism is of the security officer who binned our tin of rash cream - we had it in a bag and Frankfurt airport were happy to allow us to take it on board as it was medicinal for our son. The officer here was extremely rude and not interested."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Antonis Asprakis,United States,19th August 2015,unverified,"After several years of transiting through it, I have come to really dislike Terminal 5. The security staff appear as a whole to be unconcerned with the fact that their very slow pace could cause people to miss their flights, and I am fed up with the ridiculous amount of expensive stores that clutter the entire terminal and cause traffic bottlenecks. I also hate the fact that they do not post boarding gates until close to boarding time, meaning that you constantly have to check the monitors. The bottom line is that Terminal 5 is not designed with traveler comfort and well-being in mind - it is, however, designed to divorce you from your money whenever possible."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Tim Shaw,United Kingdom,15th August 2015,unverified,"Terminal 5 - the aggression of the security staff was something I have never experienced before in the UK. They seemed to genuinely enjoy being nasty to people and shouting as much as possible. A couple next to us were selected to have their hand luggage searched. The man asked the security officer whether this could cause them to miss their flight (they were running late) and his response was ""it might do"". He then proceeded to go and chat to a colleague leaving them helpless. They had clearly been on holiday in the UK and I felt so sorry for them. The terminal itself is great if you like endless luxury shops. If you do not, bring a book (there is nowhere other than WH Smith to buy one though). I will ensure that I do not use this airport again."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Ollie James,United Kingdom,14th August 2015,unverified,"Flew with Continental/United out of Terminal 4 and had a very smooth run through check-in and security and was air-side in no time. We enjoyed a very nice full English breakfast which was just what we needed before an 8 hour flight. The terminal was very clean and tidy. Some people mention bad handling of baggage at Heathrow but I have never ever had any issue whatsoever. Overall, I highly value Heathrow Airport and would place it in the Top 3 in the world."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,W Johnson,United Kingdom,14th August 2015,unverified,"Was greeted with a terrible attitude from a female member of staff responsible for handling the trays which were passing through for security checks when departing at Terminal 5. She was rude and condescending towards myself, my family members and other passengers. I realise that the airport is busy and the job may at times be hectic but I see no justification for such outright rudeness. Such members of staff could use some basic retraining in customer service, although it isn't difficult however to incorporate some simple pleasant and polite manners towards other people into your working day."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Freda Mary Buirski,Qatar,13th August 2015,unverified,I can't speak highly enough of the customer assistance program. My husband and I flew in from Doha in transit to Aberdeen. I had broken my ankle a few weeks previously and was on crutches. The wheelchair assistant was waiting for me as I disembarked and I was transported with speed and efficiency including a change of terminal. The staff we encountered were very professional and pleasant.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,10th August 2015,unverified,"Use T5 a lot, but for the first time ever there were snake queues at check in. My flight was being checked in at desks B,C,D and F. Massive queue at B desks, so popped over to C desks and was checked in within 5 minutes. From recent experience security south is usually less busy than security North"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Craig,United Kingdom,3rd August 2015,unverified,I was embarrassed by the attitude of one of the security workers in T5 yesterday.  I understand they have a job to do and security and safety of all passengers comes first but manners cost nothing. A gentle reminder to customers is all that is needed. 
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,O Omar,United Arab Emirates,1st August 2015,unverified,"Arrived on BA from Dubai at Terminal 5 at around 6 am, along with a bunch of long-haul 747/777/A380 arrivals from all over the world. There were bottlenecks on the walk from the gate down to the shuttle trains which take people from the remote satellite terminals to the 'main' part of T5 which houses passport control/baggage reclaim as well as check-in/security on departure. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get on a train, because in many cases the shuttles would arrive from the previous stop (the C gates) already full. Was a bit stressful. At passport control, it was a 30-minute wait for non-EU nationals, expected as this was the morning rush. Immigration officer was courteous and polite (am a frequent visitor to the UK, so minimal questions asked). She endorsed (i.e. stamped) the wrong visa, and when I pointed out her error, she rectified her mistake with minimal fuss. Bags didn't take much time. Very convenient vending machines if you need to pick up a SIM card in the baggage claim hall-if not, there are several shops in the arrivals area selling UK SIM cards, plus WHSmith and a few other outlets. Signage to Heathrow Express clear, and in 20 minutes was in central London. Departure: Arrived on the HEX, and wanted to do VAT refund, but the office was on the other side of the terminal, and quite busy at that, so I ended up ditching-they should have a VAT refund office on either end of the large T5 check-in area. My flight left at 1pm, and there were quite a number of flights leaving, a mixture of European and intercontinental flights. Used self-service kiosks to print BPs, then waited for a good 30 minutes in the bag drop queue. Would be much more efficient to have a proper self check-in service, where passengers can print and stick their bag tags themselves. Although the queue to get into security was short, getting in line to go through the scanner, then waiting again for the bags to come out through the machine all ended up taking a good 15 minutes. By then, only had 70 minutes or so until departure. Bearing in mind that my flight left from Gate B35, which required another ride on the shuttle, only had 20-25 minutes to grab a bit and run. Despite arriving 3 hours in advance, with the all the walking and waiting, felt like I was cutting it close. Overall a mixed bag. I highly recommend anyone planning on doing a VAT refund to get there a good 4 hours before their flight (and of course, you need to be prepared to show them your purchases, so unless it's in your carry-on, you need to do this before checking in your bags)."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Eleanor Sam,United States,28th July 2015,unverified,"In all my traveling years, never such rudeness and unprofessional treatment than by a staff at Heathrow Airport. Request for assistance was turned down in my attempt to ask for the need for landing card as my next flight was leaving in the next three hours and another staff member sitting at a chair next to immigration line as I was waiting to have my passport stamped, harassed me about stepping out of the line to talk with her about how I was talking to the other staff in my inquiry about the landing card. She continued to lecture me  how I should correctly""talk to the staff.  I suggest the staff be retrained on their customer service skills. "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,N Griffith,Thailand,26th July 2015,unverified,"Terminal 2 is still a disorganised mess. My partner and I used the self service boarding pass scanners just before security, only to find before we boarded that they hadn't worked properly. Although the gates had opened and let us and several other travellers through they had not taken the picture. After this came security, which was fine. However, after this there appeared to be no signs pointing you to border control, and in fact it was tucked away in a corner on a lower level. we walked around in a confused state with no staff actively trying to mange this. The building is designed horribly so that you have no real confidence about where you are going. A rude immigration officer completed the experience for us. Absolutely terrible."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Alan Macpherson,United States,24th July 2015,unverified,"So, arrive at Edinburgh Intl Airport on time and go through the usually inefficient but very thorough UK security screening and passport control. This works relatively 'well'. Our flight arrives late to Heathrow though, and then the real fun begins. After a thorough security check by British officials in Edinburgh, we are subject to that all over again after an excruciatingly long bus ride between idiotically poorly connected terminals (arrival at T5 and departure for LAX at T3). Both times we're ""randomly picked"" for a 2nd level security check. So OK, through all that and then we need to re-check in again for the AA flight to LAX (after printing boarding passes online with all docs verified). Why? Then we are so lucky to actually learn of the departure gate a full 5 minutes before all the other clueless passengers who are anxiously watching the monitors. This is one of the silliest parts of the operation: holding the gate secret until 20 minutes before boarding. Anyway, rush to the very far away gate, and then into a new secure area- yes another check of passport and boarding pass that gains us access to the usual ugly 'stall' with no services and no bathrooms. There more poor people (thankfully not us) being checked by yet more random searching. Heathrow, the world's worst large-sized airport in my opinion, needs to have its security and other logistical systems completely overhauled by efficiency experts. It's an embarrassment to the UK."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,N Sunder,United States,21st July 2015,unverified,"Terminal 5. Architecturally impressive, with great views and lots of natural light. Plenty of stores to keep avid shoppers occupied. The four hours of free Wi-Fi offered is a nice touch. Distances are long however, and both my recent flights arrived at either a remote stand or the satellite terminal. The policy of announcing the departure gate only an hour beforehand is annoying, especially if the departure is from the B or C gates, which take a while to get to."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,John Eustace,United Kingdom,21st July 2015,unverified,"I completely agree with reviews submitted by Alan Gerbhart and Michelle Strauss. It took me 70 minutes from arrival to clearing security into Terminal 5A on 21st July despite having ""fast-track"". At immigration there was a problem scanning a baby's eyes but instead of taking the issue aside the immigration people (5) dealt with the issue at the desk holding every other customer back - there was no other desk in use at this point as every immigration officer decided they would also assist with the baby - ridiculous, and no apology obviously. At security the queues were surprisingly short (see immigration issue) but they still insisted on swabbing bags and items unnecessarily, even lifting chocolates out of my daughters bag and re-scanning them - why? We also had a duty free bottle of perfume, sealed in the bag with the receipt but again they insisted on opening it and testing it - is there no-one with any common sense employed? And of course no sign of supervision or management anywhere. I compare you to many other international hubs I travel through and without doubt immigration and security here are the worst for organisation, worst for customer service and worst for passenger management I have ever had the displeasure to come across. "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,D Edwards,United Kingdom,20th July 2015,unverified,"Terminal 2 - This Terminal appears to have been deliberately designed to make things as difficult as possible for passengers to negotiate. If you are not young and fit I would suggest you avoid it. I have some mobility issues and I found this Terminal difficult in the extreme. Plenty of room in Car Park then lifts take you to area out in front of Terminal Building. When you enter you are met by automatic check-in machines with desks behind but no staff to help you find out what you need to do. I decided to avoid the machines and eventually find the EVA Air Business Class check-in desk. Staff here were excellent. I make my way to Security. Despite being very quiet, passengers are still made to snake through the movable barriers forcing them to walk about 20 times further than necessary. Fairly quick getting through the checks and then passports. Now the problems really begin. The signs inside the Terminal building are unclear and totally inadequate. I eventually work out I now need to go down a level. The lifts throughout the terminal are generally tucked away, difficult to find, and at least half appear to be marked 'Staff Only'. At the next level I again can't find any clear signs to show how to get to the Business Lounge, which I was told was near the gate. The design of this level is awful. There are no clear, easy routes to get across. Passengers are forced to walk much further than necessary. It appears to be in order to make them go as close to as many shops as possible. I eventually find the exit I need in the far corner. I now have to go down yet another level. I am now faced with a lifeless corridor. It is a very, very long walk from here to the gates and the Lounge. There are some moving walkways. By the time I get close to the gates I am in pain. I now discover I have to go back up a level to get to the Lounge. Unbelievable! I then have to go back down and walk a little further to get to the gate when it's time to board. Boarding was shambolic. No information given. One mad scrum and slow moving queues. Arriving back in the Terminal was no better. On leaving the plane I have to immediately use a small, slow lift to go up a level. There is then quite a walk. I then have to find a lift to go up another level. The lifts are an even further walk, with confusing signs and most of the lifts marked 'Staff Only' or 'Buggies Only'. The sign in the lift says I need Level 3 for Arrivals but there are only buttons for 0 and 2! There is then a very, very, very long walk and the need to use yet another lift. I eventually get to Passport Control. I have a Priority Lane pass but there are very few staff in it so there is quite a wait. Through Customs then outside to find the way to taxis. I find I have to walk to the other end of the concourse and go down a level in the lift. I then have another quite long walk to the taxi queue. There are plenty of taxis for the number of people waiting but only one member of Airport staff doing the taxi bookings. A long wait. I have travelled a great deal over many years and Heathrow T2 is, without doubt, the worst one I have gone through in terms of access, passenger convenience and ease of use. I find it staggering that it has been expensively re-designed very recently and this us the result. I shall be doing all I can to avoid using it"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Chris Turner,United Kingdom,20th July 2015,unverified,"Travelling with a disabled person. Regret to report that compared to all other airports we used Heathrow came a long way last. Wheelchair users - don't let them take your wheelchair away until you get to the plane. We did and my wife was taken by LHR wheelchair to a holding area where she was put on a seat and the wheelchair taken away - and left there for over an hour. She was then taken by buggy to a lift and had to ""walk"" to the departure gate where she was transferred to transport to the plane. On our return to LHR we held onto the wheelchair which was brought to the plane but it took over 45 minutes to arrange transport to the baggage reclaim."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,John Treanor,Germany,10th July 2015,unverified,"Terminal 5 : I cannot echo enough the review of Michelle Straus. From the time I put my first bag on the belt to the time I got my bags back after a pointless swabbing exercise was 35 mins. Queuing time to get to the belt was only 7 mins. The whole process needs review - rejecting bags randomly and then swabbing them 20 times while mountains of luggage build up on the belts and people are in a frenzy to catch their flights.  Don't use the excuse ""but we are just keeping you safe Sir"" - other airports keep us equally safe in a much more pleasant and stress free fashion. I don't think its a staff issue, and maybe their sullenness is simply a defence against the barrage of abuse they suffer for being at the front end of stupid processes."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Michelle Strauss,Ireland,8th July 2015,unverified,"I echo everything that Alan Gebhart put in his review - the insistence on swabbing each offending item unnecessarily, whilst massive queues build up. We had exactly the same problem and missed our flight as a result. Some security staff are a combination of incompetence whilst having contempt for passengers. It's a most unpleasant experience using this airport."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,D Powell,United States,8th July 2015,unverified,"Our first time through Heathrow, there was a guide to tell people which way to go when they disembarked from their connecting flight. On the way back, we had to find someone to help us. We only had an hour layover coming back to the USA. Security is very slow at this airport. We would not have made our connecting flight if I had not asked one of the security personnel to help us get through so as not to miss the flight. He was nice and helped us get through the line. It is better to have about a two hour layover to make a connecting flight here."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Monique Vanhuizen,United Kingdom,3rd July 2015,unverified,"Having limited mobility, and only able to walk very slowly, and painfully, with the aid of two crutches, we arrived at Terminal 5, (Mid morning - Thursday 18th June) and pressed the outside button for those who require assistance. We were told that somebody would be with us in 5 minutes. Half an hour later, and despite a further 3/4 presses on the bell, still nothing. Eventually, as time was passing by quickly, and we needed to catch the flight, I slowly hobbled to the desk where this lack of service was 'co-ordinated'. The only explanation given by the sole person at the desk for this lack of service was that neither he, nor the woman pushing the wheelchair, knew where the various numbered locations were around the airport! Eventually I was taken in a chair, to the relevant Gate for the flight, but had to painfully and slowly walk the remaining distance to board the aircraft. Although allowed to set off before other passengers, in order that I could get to the seat before fellow passengers, this wasn’t possible, as I was soon overtaken by others on the way. Arrival back at Terminal 5 wasn't much better, again with some delay, finally being 'dumped' at baggage reclaim, although we had none to collect, and that was it! From there to the area where the taxi could pick us up, was a further long walk. "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Nigel Stacey,United Kingdom,1st July 2015,unverified,"I am a very frequent flyer for leisure only, I flew out of terminal 2 and back through terminal 4. The walk from the Heathrow express station seemed never ending then after check-in it was time to face the security check, why do they always treat people as though you've never flown before, my iPad was in my hand and my liquids in a bag, this being my 11th trip of the year, they seem to forget I am an airport customer not just a flight ticket. If they were ever polite I would think there was something wrong. I found the process of going through check in and security very faceless and impersonal, then when I got through the to the airside part of the terminal I found terminal two very cramped, the food available very lacking and overpriced, in fact the meal deal in WH Smiths was the best choice. Overall my thoughts of Heathrow is that they want my money but forget what the passenger actually wants or how we wish to be treated."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Lars Bosteen,Philippines,27th June 2015,unverified,"Terminal 3. No major problems with arrival (6.30am) though lots of walking. The automated passport machines seem pointless as they aren't much faster than human beings. Getting to the underground is easy enough. For departure (12.25pm), check-in was quick and security took about 15 minutes. The departure area is spacious, there are plenty of places to eat and shop, and the free Wi-Fi works very well."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Alan Gebhart,United States,26th June 2015,unverified,"We were First Class passengers flying through LHR on our way to Athens from IAD. I have transited or arrived in LHR more times than I can count, always on British Airways. This was the worst experience ever. My traveling companion had forgotten to remove two small liquid containers from his luggage to be scanned separately in a plastic bag. Although we were in the FastTrack line, we were shunted off to a secondary screening line where the hand baggage of individual passengers who did not somehow pass the screening were sent. The gentleman at the head of the line said he had been there for over an hour and had already missed his flight. There were a number of other people in line. The secondary screeners were rude and unprofessional, and the process was vastly over-complicated. Security is a necessity, but efficiency is also important. It appeared that each individual compartment in any hand luggage that had some sort of violation had to be swabbed, and the swabs read. There was a single person doing this, and the line kept getting longer and longer. A supervisor came over several times but left after a few minutes, doing nothing to remedy the hold-ups. We finally were cleared after almost 90 minutes in this line. The offending liquids could have been removed, put into a separate tray, and the offending liquids and bags could have been resent through the screening machines. This process is often used in other airports when there is a problem with hand baggage. This was the worst and most unprofessional screening I have ever seen. "
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,F Lachehab,United Kingdom,18th June 2015,unverified,"London Heathrow airport is one of the best airports. Very friendly Staff. Excellent range of facilities, lots to do while your waiting for your flight and very clean. It is absolutely huge and may confuse tourists but it is easy to get around."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,R Mark Schultz,United States,17th June 2015,unverified,"LHR can be a daunting airport, and Terminal 5 can be very busy. However, I fly through frequently, annually or so for business in the UK, more often for an Onward Journey into Europe. With reference to the Onward Journey, a couple of notes: (1) You don't go through Immigration in the UK, but you do go through Security. (2) Security can be very time-consuming, especially and oddly on weekend mornings. Allow plenty of time. (3) While the UK is (still) in the EU, it is not a Schengen country. This means you will have to go through Immigration in the country of your end destination. Give yourself plenty of time in Terminal 5, and enjoy it. Wonderful shopping, great restaurants and superior lounges. It can be a really pleasant place to beb"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,F Chang,Malaysia,17th June 2015,unverified,"It took us 70 minutes to transit due to the long immigration queues and security checks. They are clearly overwhelmed by the enormous number of transit passengers in Terminal 5. Restaurant prices for Mains alone start from £12 onwards to £90. Drinks are expensive as well. You are better off buying sandwiches, drinks and newspaper for £3 at the newsagent on level 1 Terminal 5 where u get out of security check. Only 2 places to charge your phones or iPads and they are overcrowded. That is next to Starbucks at gate A10. Good children's playground though. They take ur names and flight numbers just in case you are late."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Janey Buckley,Australia,15th June 2015,unverified,"Really impressed with Heathrow Terminal 3 on my most recent visit. Flew in from Brisbane and Dubai hardly any wait time at all through customs and immigration even though I was travelling on my Australian passport rather than British one. My baggage came out very quickly and everything was well signed and easy to follow. On my departure back to Sydney was impressed how quick the wifi was even though the departure lounge was packed with travellers using laptops and tablets. All staff are very friendly, helpful and courteous. Well done Heathrow."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,C Teeple,United States,15th June 2015,unverified,"Terminal 5 is very crowded, with long queues to get through security and too many people everywhere. Not designed to handle the number of people using it. Recommend you bypass Heathrow if at all possible."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,D Morgan,Australia,15th June 2015,unverified,"Horrible in just about every way that matters.  Transferring between terminals in peak periods is a nightmare (I missed my connecting flight due to inadequate and infrequent shuttle buses and long queues, so allow at least twice the recommended minimum connecting time), security screening is inefficient and pathetically slow; and staff are a combination of rude, surly and aggressive.  International travel is hard enough without having to contend with Heathrow Airport.  They should sell ""I survived Heathrow"" t-shirts - they'd make a fortune!  My wife and I were supposed to fly to Heathrow again in a couple of months, but we cancelled our flights and will be going to a different destination.  I will never set foot in Heathrow again if I can help it, and I pity those who have no choice.
"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,R Palmer-Jones,,12th June 2015,unverified,"Terminal 5 in terminal decline? In the last couple of years Terminal 5 has been getting dirtier, the security screening seems inefficient, cramped, untidy, sometimes there is a fast track and often not, the passport control has untidy queues and often seems short of staff, and today toilets were filthy. However they seem to be able to spend money on constantly increasing the retail outlets, and moving them ever upmarket. I flew in from Zurich, also expensive, but so much cleaner and more efficient."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Kevin Barrance,United Kingdom,11th June 2015,unverified,"I have nothing but praise for Heathrow T5 on my recent trip. Everything on the way out went well, minimal queues at security and pleasant staff. The arrival experience was amazing. From landing to being in my car in 30 minutes! Even small airports straggle to manage that. Excellent all round."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,T Bradberry,United Kingdom,1st June 2015,unverified,Terminal 5. Appalling poor customer service massive queues poor signs limited seating rude security staff long queues everywhere.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Brian Reeder,United Kingdom,31st May 2015,unverified,Arrived in T5 on 28th May 20.00hrs as is always the case BA flight from Brussels was delayed. However was amazed astonished disgusted with the lack of organisation in the immigration processing hall some staff were arguing aggressively with passengers who understandably were showing their frustration with the situation. It took a minimum of 45 minutes to process through immigration no explanation or apology no advance warning even on the flight. I will try to avoid Heathrow in future in the same way I try to avoid British Airways.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,K Emrich,Ireland,31st May 2015,unverified,Transited through Terminal 5 on the 18th May 2015 travelling from Dublin to Tokyo. Landed at Heathrow late morning. Passport control at flight connections was a chaotic mess between staff and passengers nobody seemed to know what was going on. Huge queue and badly organised. Finally got through. Found a lot of the terminal was under renovation. All the shops were luxury shops too expensive for most people and the restaurants were the same. And the terminal was very overcrowded. Then when I went to get my flight directions were poor realised very late that my gate was on lower level. Other passengers were also late finding the gate. Then had to take bus a ridiculously long way to the plane. It took forever. So flight was late departing which meant being stuck in a long queue to take off. I have always found Heathrow a good airport for transfers. This was my first time at Terminal 5 though and it was a disaster. Will avoid Terminal 5 from now on.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,R Mortara,United Kingdom,31st May 2015,unverified,My first use of the new Terminal 2. On departure the check-in area is large and spacious like the old T1 its on a level up from roadside so you approach via an elevated road. Once through security (no problems there with the staff) there are enough seats for everyone. My main gripe is the place lacks that certain atmosphere the old T2 had. It all seemed a bit too new and sterile. Walking under the aircraft parking area to get to the departure gate was a little annoying but moving walkways help. On return the corridor from the gate to the security/passport area is so narrow its a joke. That said everything is on one level and walking distances are short. Spoilt by the queue at the e-passport booths but made up somewhat by fast baggage delivery and a short walk to get outside for the buses to the car parks. Shame then you have to go down a level to get to them. Guess T2 is like so many new terminals; functional but lacks individuality and character.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,M Higgins,United Kingdom,31st May 2015,unverified,We recently arrived into T5 from Boston. We were embarrassed by our own country. It was understaffed and poorly laid out and we barely made our connection. Security took an age to get through - and why do you need to go through X-ray etc again when you have just landed? The train transfers were packed so very few people could board and the electronic passport controls seemed to malfunction more often than they worked. It was a complete fiasco.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Laurence Hayes,Australia,31st May 2015,unverified,I have to say the new T2 is a missed opportunity. Whilst the new terminal is obviously a generational step forward on the old many of the practical aspects of the design are deficient. The lifts and escalators up from the rail station to departures go through a huge covered outdoor void a strange choice in a city where the average temp is low. This looks even more of a deficiency when you enter the departures section inside and see it is cramped. People tripping over each other to deposit bags too few check-in kiosks etc.. Why did they scrimp on the area of the departures hall interior when they had literally acres of adjacent space under cover outside. Equally baffling was despite building this huge outdoor covered void the car and bus drop off areas are uncovered requiring passengers to still walk out in the rain. Again a strange choice for a wet city like London. All in all for a brand new terminal I would give it's design a pass mark at best.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Phillip Nunn,United Kingdom,22nd May 2015,unverified,T3 arrival only. Plane arrived early but delay due to airbridge issues meant late getting off. Gate was a long way from immigration. On the walk there I was passed by many fast walkers and even people running. When I arrived there I could see why long lines for the automatic passport gates only 3 later 4 UK/EU passport desks open and 1 or maybe 2 other passports open. Only advantage to the long wait for passport control was the bag was on the belt when I got there I was lucky as it was stopped and it looked like they were having issues restarting it. After customs I went to look for the shuttle bus to my hotel only to find the bus stops arrows pointed in 3 different directions depending on stand number but I spotted an information stand near one of the signs so went to ask where I found 2 members of staff chatting. After a while standing there I interrupted them with an 'excuse me' and my answer was a thumb in the general direction of one of the arrows without them breaking their conversation. I know the immigration issues are not totally under BAA's control but it does let down the whole airport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,J Chan,Hong Kong,22nd May 2015,unverified,Hong Kong to London Heathrow T3. May 22nd 2015 6.40am arrival. 1 hour + wait for baggage. Terrible service - the whole process of landing at Heathrow (any terminal) is slow. Take a leaf out of Hong Kong's book and see how efficient they are. No excuses please improve for everyone's good judgement when they arrive into the UK.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Billl Atkins,United Kingdom,20th May 2015,unverified,Arrived T5 Satellite B Sunday May 17 at 6.15 am - a busy time of day. Got from plane door to meeting my ride in less than 15 minutes. Granted no bags but did have E-Gate malfunction and had to go to the desk. Never achieved that kind of speed at the other airports everyone raves about in this forum.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,D Nachiket,India,20th May 2015,unverified,The Airport is clean. But the food outlets in Terminal 4 seems to offer few vegetarian options. That should be taken care of. Secondly wifi is free for 8 hours. I know no one will stay at an airport for 8 hours unless necessary. Wifi should be free all the time.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,N Baker,Australia,20th May 2015,unverified,Terminal 4. When will Heathrow become international? The complete attitude from customs in astonishing. I had to wait 15 min until customs could be bothered to check my bag only for them to tell me it was because I had left my iPad in my bag. Every other airport tells you to leave it in your bag? No signage to suggest otherwise just the attitude. To claim the VAT back leads you to unpack all items or again facing the attitude of customs who tell you to produce all items to be claimed. Will avoid at all costd in the future!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,V Hills,United Kingdom,13th May 2015,unverified,Terminal 5 security appears short staffed and the supervisor at A gates on the 11th May appears to relish upping the chance of people missing connecting flights. I travelled on a BA flight from JFK arriving into Heathrow at 06.35 with a connecting BA flight to Leeds Bradford due to fly at 08.55. We followed instructions for the transit and passed quickly through passport control. When we arrived at security it was very crowded as I realise many flights arrive in early morning. Nevertheless the queue moved and finally it was my turn. Having gone through security at JFK I hadn't thought there would be a problem but stupidly I forgot that I had a small bottle of wine from the overnight flight in my handbag. Quite rightly this was picked up and my tray set aside and joined the queue of another 8 trays of hand luggage that had to be checked. Time was suddenly against me. I realised what the problem was and asked if the bottle could be removed and rechecked to expedite myself getting to the gate. This is not possible. I was told to ask the supervisor. The rude indifference of this man was so frustrating. In the end the lady checking the bags said if the others awaiting their bags to be checked were OK to let mine go in front of theirs then she would check it. The offending bottle of wine was removed and the bag rechecked and I ran as fast any 63 year old woman can run to Gate A2 where my friend had gone to inform the staff at the gate what was happening. We got on the flight the door was closed and we pushed back. I know it was my fault but the rude indifference and almost relish of how this was handled was appalling. Next time I will go via Amsterdam. Fast track their means is more about your connecting flight time rather than your Club status and in transit security staff do not seem so poorly manned.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,M Hughes,United Kingdom,13th May 2015,unverified,"T5. Appalling security. Approximately 70% of screened bags referred for manual checks with only one person doing checks - whilst many passengers overseas did not comply with regulations on fluids this seemed to be the most common issue and therefore area is inadequately staffed. There was no information for overseas passengers prior to screening about the rules. Had to wait 40 minutes for my bag to be checked - manually to find out that there was no problem nor could the explain need for the additional check. My wife had the same issue on adjacent scanner to be told that bag laptop and fluids not ""laid out far enough apart"" in the tray and her wait was 50 minutes. This is my first Heathrow transit in approximately 10 years as I usually can use Manchester for all of my long haul travel needs. I will avoid Heathrow in the future."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,T Elliott,United Kingdom,11th May 2015,unverified,I travel regularly for work and have used Heathrow Terminal 5 6 times already this year and each time it has been a total shambles. Anyone transferring to a connecting flight here has to face the very real possibility of missing their flight and dealing with some of the most aggressive and rude security staff in the world. The connection system does not work and I'm embarrassed that this is the major hub of UK. I would strongly advise all passengers to use and of the other major European hubs when transferring as Heathrow in my honest opinion is worse the worst in the continent. I assume that the ineffective system is due to too much space been given to retail the intelligence investment in resources or bad facilities planning. On my most recent trip there were twice as many people giving out free maps of London as there were working on security. Hopefully I will not be back here for sometime.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Kunal Chandra,Canada,10th May 2015,unverified,T2. New terminal for Star Alliance Member Airlines. London Heathrow has changed since I last visited this place back in 2002. Terminal 2 for Star Alliance is huge and really expensive if you want to eat breakfast lunch or dinner. I suggest you use your credit card and leave the cash with you if you need it for emergency. You really need extra time to catch your next flight if your traveling abroad especially if your traveling on a different airline like British Airways Qatar Airways etc. May I suggest that you go through security to give you extra time to catch your night flight with this terminal 2. Well done Star Alliance for opening this airport. For those flying on business or first class be aware about four airline lounges at Star Alliance Terminal 2 that you could use like United Airlines Lounge Air Canada Maple Leaf Lufthansa Senators Lounge as well as Star Alliance Lounge.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,A Veccio,Belgium,10th May 2015,unverified,Connected to LHR on my trip from BRU to LAX and return from SFO to BRU inbound and outbound flights were both times with BA thus connecting in from and to T5. I was really worried after all the bad reviews but had a really nice experience. I travelled economy so no fast track or lounge for me so had the basic encounter with the airport and have no complaints whatsoever. On the first leg (on a Tuesday morning around 7.30) I timed myself from the moment I stepped off the plane until I cleared security to less than 20 minutes! Lots of signs pretty clear instructions no problem. I had to take the train to T5C again nothing to worry about. On the way back coming from SFO and connecting to BRU early afternoon of another Tuesday I deplaned the A380 and timed myself again from getting off the plane (T5C) to clearing security: about 40 minutes although security was a little bit more crowded and my bag was put on the side and double checked. Overall I had a quite good experience but I can easily understand that it can quickly become a bad one when there are lots of people or when having tight and stressful connection. I found T5A to be a little bit overcrowded but you can still manage to find a place to sit. LHR is a great place for plane spotting!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,A McElligott,Ireland,6th May 2015,unverified,I am a frequent traveller and have little choice but to use Heathrow as my hub for certain flights this means transferring from T2 to T5. The transfer itself is not a problem but the security process is. I flew out to Athens and had to wait 40 minutes at security to have my toiletries checked only to be told that after the initial alarm they were safe and did not pose a 'security threat' after all. On my return went through security at flight connections carrying four tins of honey bought in Duty Free at Athens sealed in a transparent bag etc as per EU regulations. But at Heathrow one of these tins according to the machinery in use appeared to pose a 'threat to security' and I was told (politely) I could not carry the honey in my hand luggage but would have to check it in this meant leaving flight connections via the utterly chaotic passport control where the staff appear to be trained only to shout at travellers I checked my luggage with my airline and re-entered the main security area. The staff were rude and insolent. This experience is not the first I have made if I could I would find an alternative hub for my onward journeys from Ireland. And it is not just Heathrow I have experienced similar at both Stansted and Gatwick. UK airports are now to be avoided at all costs. Rudeness is the norm and a complete lack of common sense.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,5th May 2015,unverified,Flew From T2 to Toronto. Nice airy spacious terminal. It is all self service now meaning you even have to print your own labels. A female member of staff spoke to us very rudely when we asked for help with the labels. Instead of patronising people with your superior smugness you might want to hop to a counter and serve people in the old fashioned way you used to. Very disappointing. Otherwise fine but the usual range of high end and rip off shops airside.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Nicolas Simonis,Greece,1st May 2015,unverified,Athens - London - Philadelphia dep on 18/3 return 19/4 via BA terminal 5. An absolute disappointment in this confusing and complicated terminal packed like sardines in that train though a world traveler lost in that confusing terminal and my polite request to an airport employee for directions received an angry and impolite reply. On my return I had to rush to catch my onward flight to Athens I pushed my way in that train like a sardine and took an oath to avoid this terminal in the future. I must compliment a BA employee who was extremely willing and helpful at gate 14 - if I remember well.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Alastair Finch,United Kingdom,22nd April 2015,unverified,Flew out of T5 transferring from inbound Manchester flight was easy enough required internal train but spotless terminal and plenty of seating at gate.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Thitiya Westoby,Thailand,19th April 2015,unverified,"Terminal 2 is now akin to a ""lost cost airline"" terminal - meaning DIY. When you check in for your flight you have no choice you have to scan your passport and then print your own boarding card and your luggage tag and apply the luggage tag yourself to your bags before you are permitted to join the queue to fully check in and talk to someone which then takes the same time as a normal check in at any other airport. Many staff standing around (and few very helpful and most frankly rather condescending towards customers who just do not get the concept) that actually could be put to better use by getting behind the desks and checking you into your flight and conducting the full procedure like any other airport. Security very disorganized and not efficient at all and WiFi in the terminal is hopeless as keeps cutting out. Many staff including gate staff and G4 Security staff borderline rude towards customers in the way they talk and look at people and just too many all standing around and talking to each other. Other facilities within the terminal are satisfactory including the restaurants and duty free."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Diana Buckle,Hong Kong,16th April 2015,unverified,An international traveller does not have too much expectation on any airport but so far Heathrow is still considered to be a very busy international airport. Nothing to do with the facilities but the security staff. 10 out of 10 that I read them are rude and impatient. I witnessed one of the security officers shouting at a passenger I heard the lady only asking about the security procedures. She said nothing wrong. If staff cannot deal with their daily workloads then the job is unsuitable for them.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Jeff Michel,Switzerland,16th April 2015,unverified,Arrived at the new T2 and it looked very well laid out and exited quickly. The problem is the congestion of planes not the terminal. Having landed it is really unacceptable to be left on a taxiway for 15 minutes because a gate was not available. LHR want another runway but they cannot even handle the flights they already have. A shame because the new T2 looked really nice but it just takes too long for planes to park getting to car rental etc.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Nicky Binder,United Kingdom,14th April 2015,unverified,What a shame that T2 doesn't have the passenger in mind what an opportunity missed and what was the thinking behind the design? Indeed design a fab new building but not for the purpose of architectural vanity. You forgot the passenger experience here. I have travelled widely internationally but the distance travelled from check in to my outgoing SQ flight and baggage reclaim from my incoming SQ flight takes some beating quite bonkers. What should be a relatively smooth and stress free transition to and from flights has become a heck of a long walk but at least it got my leg muscles working after a 13 hr flight! As for arriving by the Heathrow Express or Tube - add another 30 mins after you have your bags once you have negotiated the barriers and stranded trolleys. Why are we unable to access these services from within the building rather than having to exit and then descend via slow elevators or escalators? Give me T4 any day. So the important point here is make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to the departure gate indeed the 2-3 hr check-in timeline from ticketing to the gate has never been more relevant with the new T2.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Michael Smith,United Kingdom,3rd April 2015,unverified,Without doubt the worst airport in the world including Lagos. Had the misfortune to arrive after departing from Dubai int. airport. What a culture shock! From happy smiling faces to misery. Miserable faces terrible customer service and downright rudeness. Travelled with Virgin which was wonderful. Required assistance for walking difficulties. Wonderful help until Terminal 3. Arguments about who would pick me up someone took me from plane to halfway to first ramp. Waited ages for electric truck got another 50 yards then told could go no further. Managed to walk the rest of way to baggage reclaim. Spoke to lady there about assistance that had been booked. Told me to sit and wait but no seats! After waiting 20 mins my wife and I struggled to car park. What a shambles.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Bill Atkins,United Kingdom,24th March 2015,unverified,T5 arrived in the early morning rush. Was through all controls and back in lounge in 30 minutes which has been a fairly typical experience. I think may critics have unreal expectations of a very large airport. I have travelled extensively and Heathrow compares well with most others. All airports require security when connecting and many now have trains/escalators to connect between terminals - why do people complain when asked to do the same here ? I am in my 60's and have no trouble managing to get from A to B and I find that signage is perfectly adequate if you bother to look at it. Staff may be less than friendly but that has been my experience in most of the airports around the world.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,I Lancaster,United Kingdom,20th March 2015,unverified,My first time through T2. Who designed this passenger nightmare! OK so check-in and getting through passport check and security was OK (Heathrow is an airport that has invested in decent security arrangements). But then to the gate - nightmare! Long walks inadequate moving walkways - where's the train or people mover?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,S Chapman,United Kingdom,17th March 2015,unverified,Transferred from an international flight in T2 to a domestic one. My incoming flight was a little late admittedly but the extremely long queue for EU immigration was being handled by one person. No-one in authority to organise the priority of any passengers. The people in front of me had a 4 hour period - I had half an hour. The queue for international immigration was almost non-existent but the haughty woman said she was unable to assist. A staff member with a walkie talkie appeared and then proceeded to tell us he had no responsibility for this area. Here's a suggestion - use your initiative and find someone who is. Eventually two people came along and proceeded to prioritise flights which were later than ones almost ready to depart the story goes on and on but the woman then proceeded to yell at me that I had 2 minutes or I would miss my flight. Have travelled extensively around the world and I have never seen such a mismanaged situation. I was embarrassed to be British!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,J Hong,Canada,17th March 2015,unverified,"This has got to be the world's worst airport. Been here numerous times and not impressed. Sure it has its fancy expensive shops to make revenue but what about the people who want to sit down? Here's why I gave Heathrow 0/10. 1. Not enough seating areas - simply unacceptable. 2. Uncomfortable chairs - when the airport gives its passengers delays after delays at least provide comfortable chairs. Ever seen reclining chairs or free massage chairs in Singapore? 3. No trolleys - this one just blew me away. What if there are some pregnant/elderly or even just want some weight off your shoulders after a 13hr flight (like me 4 days ago)? Sorry not at Heathrow. First airport that I've seen that doesn't have trolleys. 4. Delays - this is bound to happen and I understand that. But if I can predict that I will have a delay that's sad. How did I predict? Well on a perfectly fine day without snow fog heavy rain wind etc. On the departure gate screen there were about 75% flights that were delayed. It seemed that the longer haul were taking off without delay but within Europe everyone was getting delayed. Then to make matters worse they decided to tell the passengers that the plane have ""not arrived yet"" when it was standing outside the window the whole time. 3hr delay with the plane there all along. Why? To fit 3 different flights in to 1. Again I understand that sometimes they have to do what the have to do but what I don't understand is why were 75% of all flights at Heathrow delayed? Why did everything have to be so disorganized? I felt extremely disappointed and its a shame that in my future travels I will try to avoid this airport at all costs even if that means paying for a more expensive ticket."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Neel Gupta,India,17th March 2015,unverified,After reading the scary reviews of LHR T5 I was rather apprehensive about my experience when I flew into London on British Airways from Delhi last year. Let me make this clear I had a perfectly good experience both ways. Arrival was a breeze. So was the return journey.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Julie Eyett,United Kingdom,4th March 2015,unverified,Absolutely appalling return to the UK after visiting relatives in USA for bereavement. Treated like cattle airport staff could not communicate in clear English we were polite they were insulting. Long walks for elderly dad.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,P Highfield,United Kingdom,24th February 2015,unverified,I don't understand why after billions of investment in T5 BA are still using buses for some flights to and from the plane. It really spoils the experience as well as taking much longer when time is critical. the bus driver on the return wasn't smooth. It's bad enough for able bodied people. Is BA doing this to save money? If so shame on them. I thought of seen the last of this outdated service in the UK which treats passengers like cattle.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,P Howard,United Kingdom,24th February 2015,unverified,My wife and I returned through Terminal 4 from Manila on 19th Feb and were really appalled at the manner of the Immigration Officers on duty. They have no manners are not polite - no please or thank you. We have travelled through many countries and have always been treated with respect and politeness - what a shame that our own Country is let down so badly by it's frontline staff.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,P Woodcock,Japan,18th February 2015,unverified,Travelled through T5 on my way to Manchester. Only issues where minor delays caused by a plane blocking our gate on arrival which was cleared quickly and a minor moment of confusion over which passport line to go through. Luckily plenty of people in purple jackets to ask! Plenty of facilities for passengers if you want something to eat or drink. Terminal is relatively easy to navigate. Does it set my world on fire? No. Its an airport. But as airports go there are many many others which are far far worse. And very very few which are better.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,19th January 2015,unverified,Flew Heathrow to Frankfurt to connect to Sao Paulo flight. Flew from new Queens Terminal and loved it. Obviously the investment is paying off. Light airy and no queues to speak of. Well done Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Gene Hartis,United States,19th January 2015,unverified,"I have flown into almost every major airport in North America Europe and Asia. Heathrow is the worst major airport by far. Terminals are a maze lack moving walks info screens at gates and any amenities other than restrooms until you have passed through Customs and security. You must pass through customs even if not entering UK. Information provided is last minute confusing or simply repeatedly incorrect. Changing terminals involves lengthy bus rides steps and lack of assistance to anyone not in a wheelchair. Terminal transport trolleys sit unmanned and unused. For city with extensive efficient Tube and transport system the airport is a navigational joke. Don't get in the wrong line or you will start over probably in wrong line again since information is reluctantly provided by indifferent and sometimes rude airport staff. Security personnel are either the friendliest and most polite or nastiest individuals you will encounter during your airport ""holiday"". BA staff are dismissive or condescending. Be prepared to lug carry-on and yourself up and down steps long distances onto the tarmac and on/off numerous buses where you are treated like cattle. We even had to board and carry luggage up the gangway (about 30 steep steps) to a 747 parked on tarmac after an ""equipment change"". Do not know how persons older or less fit than we were able to do so as no help was offered by staff. Avoid Heathrow at all cost. Is worth paying a little more for an airline that does not use this airport for connections. British Air service and attitude mesh perfectly with the airport."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,L Watson,Ireland,19th January 2015,unverified,Terminal 2: Connecting from an Aer Lingus flight to an Air Canada flight (no terminal change) just before Christmas and missed the Air Canada flight due to incompetent security staff. Waited 45 mins at security (there were no queues!) to get my bag dropped on the floor and then pawed through by a rude operator while the manager refused to apologise for the slow service. After managing to make it through passport control I then faced a long walk/run to the B-wing gates where I discovered I had just missed the flight. To be fair the Air Canada staff at the gate were incredibly helpful and booked me onto the next available flight immediately.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Trevor J Aver,United Kingdom,19th January 2015,unverified,I have now used terminal 2 several times now and each time I return dreading the experience. Queues everywhere at check-in empty counters the usual bling shops and too few eating and seating places. Designed by committee and approved by the usual BAA overpaid elite who care not a jot about their travellers only revenue. Then on your return - the long walk to freedom! Endless corridors which tax the fittest and god help anyone suffering with leg problems. It is ludicrous to expect people to endure this with no seats anywhere and few toilets. Have these people not listened to anyone? Yes I know they be ordered ahead but should they not be there already? At least a wheelchair!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Rajat Gupta,United States,19th January 2015,unverified,Terminal 5 is a nightmare for intercontinental transit passenger. I have passed through many other airport but this is the worst designed airport terminal. My first flight got delayed by 3 hours and my 4 hour transit become 1 hour. I could not connect from gate C to gate A within the terminal. Reasons were: 1) Stupid design of gates A B C and security check between them takes hours. 2) Before entering gates A for transit BA checks the boarding pass and passport. Why do you need to check as the in-transit passengers just tell them the gate and passengers will manage. 3) Number of escalators up and down: I have to take 8 escalators to move from one gates to others. Who designed this.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Rico Adams,United States,19th January 2015,unverified,As one of the busiest airports you would think customs could do a better job getting people through. There is always a slow moving line with never enough agents. In the future I will do my best to avoid Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Orna Gabay,Canada,14th January 2015,unverified,Terminal 5 - traveling via London with a layover of hours in both directions. December 19th - January 4th. The passport check and security check are disorganized confusing and a pure nightmare. The wait and standstill was unbearable. Passengers were missing connecting flights stress tears and arguing. The lack of WiFi connection in this area was ridiculous. Hundreds of people just stood in lines moving one step forward every 10-15 minutes. This has been the worst experience that I've had in years.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Michael Browne,Ireland,14th January 2015,unverified,Arrived into Terminal 5 from Houston and was transferring to Dublin in same Terminal. The flight connection signs do not refer to transfers to UK and Ireland. We were told by ground staff to join the main transfer line on two occasions! These instructions were totally incorrect ! We eventually were told to join a different line. A waste of about 20 mins and we would have been about another 30 mins if we did not keep asking the ground staff. Flight to Dublin was delayed 1 hour but did not show on the information screen until original scheduled time had elapsed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,R Marsh,United Kingdom,14th January 2015,unverified,"Terminal 2 - 2 consecutive Thursday evening flights in from Munich there were delays of over one hour and over 90 minutes respectively whilst waiting on baggage. Reasons such as ""2 planes came in at once"" don't cut it. It's one of the busiest airports in the world why should planes landing at the same time be a problem or a surprise? Having to wait for plane doors to be opened (staff went to wrong end of terminal) and delays because all the biometric passport gates were closed are not good enough. No-one is ever there to take responsibility."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,N Brooker,Australia,14th January 2015,unverified,Terminal 2 at LHR - flying business class on 1 Jan and couldn't check in at the business class desk because they were too busy. I was directed to self check in and set about printing my own luggage labels and boarding passes - I needed x2 but only got one and then had to wait 20 minutes for the other one. Having got rid of my luggage I then went to vat refund desk - queue a mile long. I abandoned the VAT refund experience and then went through security - all ok but then - no mini trolleys for hand luggage. I was forced to carry x2 7 kg hand luggage bags. Suffice to say I couldn't be bothered with any shopping. I then had the bright idea of going to a business class lounge before proceeding to my gate - another bad idea. I took a very long escalator followed by 3 travelators then another 2 escalators then a lift to the Air Canada lounge. I arrived sweating with an aching shoulder. Avoid terminal 2.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,P Neagle,United Kingdom,14th January 2015,unverified,T2 - Shopping ridiculously high end - if you want cheap and cheerful food - forget it. EAT is the cheapest thing there (which says it all). Most restaurants have a name attached meaning its like you're fine dining and overly expensive. The shops are mostly high end designers. Barely anything to do. All in all really unnecessary and poorly thought out. Queue for the ticketing/check-in was a joke. Machine didn't work for us meaning we had to use the desk. We were 3rd in line straight away as there wasn't a big queue (doesn't sound too bad) however we were 3rd in line for about half an hour! So slow not very friendly or helpful.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,V Hagedorn,United Kingdom,5th January 2015,unverified,I have now used the new Terminal 2 on two occasions October and December 2014 and have been disappointed as I find there are not sufficient cafes (EAT had long queues) and I have struggled to find anything vegetarian in the restaurants. Even the vegetarian sandwiches were sold out. All in all lots of bling but that's it.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,F Ani,United Kingdom,5th January 2015,unverified,At Heathrow Terminal 5 waiting for bag drop. Absolutely unbelievable! Massive queues! Waited over 45minutes for bag drop! What's the point of having so many check-in counters but only a quarter of them is staffed! Hoping to become a world class airport? However there's not many choices when flying out or into London. Other 'London' airports are so far out of London and they are even worse then Heathrow!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,H Dein,United Kingdom,5th January 2015,unverified,Terminal 5. We arrived on an early morning flight from Cape Town and took more than an hour to get through transfer. Totally under provisioned for volume of traffic. This was not the first such experience but it was the worst to date. How can most other major airports manage to do the necessary in reasonable time?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,K Long,United Kingdom,31st December 2014,unverified,Terminal 2 a nightmare. Uncomfortable to use departures on level 5 accessible only by lifts if you have baggage. Then a walk in icy blast across an exposed area open to the elements. Self check-in a shambles. Walked forever to get to gate. I will fly from a regional airport next time and transit somewhere comfortable like Schipol or Zurich or Dubai.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,B Sandford,United Kingdom,21st December 2014,unverified,"Terminal 5. We arrived from South Africa to transfer to Edinburgh on Saturday 13th Dec and the late arriving A380 eventually parked at the far satellite - we then had to queue to board the very full transit train with everyone carrying luggage join the queue to follow ""Flight Connections"" queue to pass through passport control more escalators and walking brought us to yet another queue for security and on to the gate to queue yet again on those yellow footprints. Time to travel a few hundred yards = 70 minutes - and we caught our connection but our luggage did not. Terminal 5 seems to have been designed by the junior staff - it is not at well thought out why the complication of three separate buildings and the consequential underground railway? Terminal is such an unpleasant experience with absolutely no independent lounges and is so congested - pull it down and go back to the drawing board surely there are some competent architects who could make a much better job of it. Other large airports seem to manage it!"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Tony Banwait,United States,21st December 2014,unverified,T5 in December from and to SFO. Arguably the worst terminal ever designed. Arrival you have to go down three sets of escalators catch a train then go up three sets of escalators. Immigration lines for non-UK passport holders was some 200 people with only 3 immigration officers. Clearing immigration took me 45 minutes. Departure about 50 minutes to clear security and again with the escalators adventure. Nothing modern about this terminal. Will avoid by not flying BA.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,H Hawkins,United Kingdom,18th December 2014,unverified,"Terminal 2. I have used this ""new"" terminal several times now and each time has been an appalling experience. When you see the kind of staff operating the terminal it becomes clear why. My most recent experience this week: I had checked in online electronic boarding pass in hand so I went straight to join the lengthy queue for baggage drop. Oh no you need to queue up at one of the self check-in machines to obtain luggage labels faff about sticking them on and then rejoin the ever lengthening baggage drop queue after being curtly questioned by a miserable looking ""jobsworth"" about your destination. Baggage drop itself was OK the lady even smiled slightly - things were looking up! Next stop security I decided to join one of the shorter queues but this was clearly not allowed as I was immediately blocked by jobsworth number two who had clearly decided on my behalf that I needed to join a much longer queue. I declined his kind offer and got some indecipherable response from him so I just carried on and was through security in no time at all. Caught flight all good. Return flight into T2 last night. Plane landed on time sat on apron near T2 for 10 minutes before pilot announced that the guiding something or other to the bridge had failed and we had to wait for an operator to arrive and guide the aircraft to the stand manually. Whatever it was then took another 20 minutes or so and it was then a case of down the steps onto the wet and windy tarmac up a flight of stairs into the terminal followed by something like a half mile trek involving a mix of operating and non-operating travelators and escalators and lengthy walkways to passport control. At least passport control was fairly quiet and the luggage soon arrived on the belt which unlike my previous T2 experience was actually working. Exit to car park got in lift lift not working. Into next lift not working. Finally made it to car on level 3 in third lift. Got to exit barrier and then had to queue for over 15 minutes due to chaotic mixture of 3 exit lanes going into one and some unfortunate punter having broken down on the exit road. I hate T2 it is almost beyond belief that a new terminal like this has so many faulty operations and so many rude and disenfranchised staff."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Kevin Barrance,United Kingdom,18th December 2014,unverified,Flew from T1 to Lyon. What a shame this terminal is closing as currently it's an oasis of calm. Everything was a breeze from the security to the calm and effective BA lounge. What a joy!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,S Thomas,United Kingdom,18th December 2014,unverified,Terminal 4 don't understand why this airport receives such bad press. Terminal was busy with several flights to India plus other Asian destinations however there were lots of security channels open and the staff were handling the volume of passengers well and even with a smile. Terminal was clean lots of seats tablets for use if you want WiFi worked well and there was a nice viewing area. All staff I came across were nice and helpful. Lots of retail options available and I found the prices of duty free cheaper than the other airports I've visited in the last couple of weeks (Doha Zurich Paris Bangkok). Plus for those on a budget there's places like Pret Boots WHSmiths etc where the food was the same price as the high street. On return thanks to e-gates was through immigration in 2 minutes bags were out in 5 and was on the tube within 20 minutes of landing. Pretty impressive for an airport the size of Heathrow. I've been to some of the world's best airport (ICN SIN etc) and honestly on this occasions LHR T4 did just as good and needs to be given credit where due.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,10th December 2014,unverified,There is now so much focus on retail areas with little or no thought for the average traveling passenger. The retail outlets are all high end and seemed to be lacking customers. So much space is now taken for retail that the is little space to sit down without feeling overcrowded. T5 has a lot of construction going on considering that it is only a few years old. It's not a place you would not want to spend a lot of time in luckily I have access to the BA Lounge so I can escape the main areas however for those without access there is no other choice.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,10th December 2014,unverified,LHR T2 September (for arrival) and last week (for a quite separate departure). Works fine except that the free wifi doesn't work and the free Internet terminals use tablets - which are lousy to type on I think I'd rather pay for a proper implementation of both. This aspect was very frustrating otherwise T2 comes recommended. All the stuff we used to hate about T1 has now been attended to. The airport will also work better once Virgin's domestic flights stop next year - as we won't have to be photographed as well as everything else.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,J Rugh,United States,4th December 2014,unverified,Heathrow 5 is probably the worst airport to transit through I have ever experienced (and I have been through some bad ones in the past). They do not have a proper transit system in operation and you must go through passport control and bag screening even if you are just connecting to another flight. The screeners seemed to be working very slowly at passport control two agents were not taking people and were just chatting even though they could see that there were hundreds of people in line. At bag control they merged transit passengers with new passengers making lines very long. We had over an hour and just made our flight but our bags did not and many passengers missed flights. The English used to know how to run an airport but no longer. I will do everything I can to avoid Heathrow in the future.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Marianne Franks,United Kingdom,1st December 2014,unverified,Due to various disabilities I flew business class from Washington D C to London Heathrow. Do not do this the cabin crew were fabulous but from the second we landed it was a nightmare. Not enough wheelchairs or staff even after waiting for 15 mins I was not taken to the passport area until nearly an hour later. My husband who had come to collect me checked the landing times and it had been brought forward to 6.07 so he left our home early to drive the two hours to the airport. He was really concerned as even the cabin crew had disembarked and I was no where to be seen. All other airports were fabulous just terminal 5 with its shabby business class lounge and disabled unfriendly seats. BA really lack any duty of care towards disabled passengers once you reach terminal 5.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,T Kimberley,United Kingdom,25th November 2014,unverified,Arrived at Terminal 5 with BA from HKG and we had to wait 50 minutes for our bags to appear on the carousel! After 40 minutes I went to the baggage desk to ask what was happening and after a few phone calls the BA staff member told me it was 'just busy and it's always like this!' So if it is always that way why hasn't something been done about it? I did notice the flight crews baggage came out first on the carousel!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,D Jackson,United Kingdom,20th November 2014,unverified,Terminal 2 - a pleasant experience. Clean efficient free computer tablets to use free half hour wifi amazing stainless steel sculpture. Food is usual rip off England.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,12th November 2014,unverified,Flew to Munich from Terminal 5. Security queues were okay though not very quick. I like the display boards which show which of the two security areas has the shortest queues. Good facilities airside. Had a drink and snack at Gordon Ramsay's where the service was very slow and the price high.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Hanagarth,United Kingdom,11th November 2014,unverified,"Landed at terminal 5 at 6.15am on 3rd November on a BA flight from Miami. To say we were ""packed in like sardines"" on the monorail to the immigration and baggage reclaim area is a massive understatement too many people for the area to cope with. Whilst waiting for our cases I visited the ladies toilets. I have to ask what goes on there over night? Certainly no cleaning. They were in a disgusting condition very dirty the floor the toilets everywhere. Empty soap dispensers. I am English and quite well travelled but have never seen airport cloakrooms so bad when arriving home. Just imagine what impression this gives visitors to this country the moment they arrive here."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,David Immelman,United Kingdom,11th November 2014,unverified,05h22. Standing at immigration. Long queues! One person handling passports! Ridiculous!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Mike Ball,United Kingdom,11th November 2014,unverified,Arrived from Malta at 1910 on the 4th Nov and I was met by a member of staff at the aircraft door as requested - I was then transferred to an electric cart which dropped me off just before immigration so far so good. I was told I would have to wait for someone else to transport me through immigration to the baggage reclaim area. One hour and 10 minutes later they found somebody to take me to the baggage reclaim via immigration. Whilst waiting it was suggested that my wife (62) may like take me while a 30 something man walked beside us as he was not trained to push a wheelchair but would show us the way. I spoke to the manager in charge on the internal telephone who blamed the delay on the immigration and baggage reclaim area but refused to come up with a solution. My wife eventually went ahead to collect the baggage. Overall Heathrow should be ashamed of the way they treat disabled people with contempt but then they are only copying most other public bodies older persons not wanted.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Alan Pratt,United Kingdom,5th November 2014,unverified,Arrived back into UK on 29 October. Immigration improving for UK passport holders but there needs to be more electronic gates in Terminal 3. 5 is not sufficient to absorb times of high usage. Luggage reclaim was slower than expected.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,S Fitzgerald,United Kingdom,31st October 2014,unverified,Just awful. Check in system failed. Security incompetent and rude. Fast track is a joke. Third world airport but no one seems to care.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,A Makins,Canada,31st October 2014,unverified,First time through new T2 and not impressed. Arrived on Air Canada around 10pm. Took forever to taxi to a gate followed by a walk the length of an upper floor of the terminal followed by a very long escalator down to a lower floor and an equally long walk back again. Finally reached passport control. Usual lengthy line for non-EU passports. Fortunately I have a UK passport and headed to the line for the machines (chip passports). Only 3-4 out of maybe 8-9 machines were operational and turns out it was a lot quicker to walk up to an agent where there were no queues (as an aside why are there so many desks for EU-passports that seem very lightly used when the number of desks for non-EU passport seems so inadequate - even in a new terminal?). On return to Canada was fortunate to be able to use priority check-in (very good) and avoid the chaos of general economy check-in. More long walks. AC business lounge is close to the gate miles beyond the main shopping area (there are a couple of shops near the gates but very limited selection). Was expecting a big improvement over T3 but layout seems very poorly thought out. Too bad.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Michael Gardiner,United Kingdom,31st October 2014,unverified,I used Terminal 3 on the evening of 16 October taking the Oman Air flight to Muscat. Given that this is the oldest terminal still in use at Heathrow it was not bad at all. Security was particularly worthy of comment being quick enough (despite the usual clueless customers) and the guy who dealt with me was actually very pleasant. My bag was selected for extra screening - I have no problem with that - which was done swiftly and with some cheerful conversation. I appreciate that Heathrow operates close to full capacity and it does not take much to make it seize up but based purely on this experience there was nothing to stop me recommending the place.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Suhail Shafi,United States,22nd October 2014,unverified,I recently transited on a long haul trip from the US to India. I flew with BA using their hub at Heathrow Terminal 5. I was very impressed and happy with the terminal. I saw Heathrow after almost a decade and the improvement is quite marked. Terminal Five is a magnificent terminal ultramodern with excellent cleanliness and facilities with very professional and helpful staff. The airport has an excellent selection of shops and restaurants. What I like most about Heathrow were the staff especially the purple coated helpers whose job is to assist and guide passengers. They should have more quiet sleeping areas at the airport. Right now the only sleeping areas in the airport offer hard benches suitable for resting not sleeping. I also think lounges for pay for the use of Economy passengers would be a help to make the place for attractive for long haul flyers. All in all a good airport experience a huge improvement from a decade ago.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,John Baxter,United Kingdom,22nd October 2014,unverified,Arrived at new terminal 2 on 15 October. Gate was not ready even though the terminal is not yet fully operational. No ground crew to install chocks etc. Massive long walk to immigration through mile long passages and the longest escalators in the world. Only 2 staff at immigration and biometric machines were not working. How badly designed is this terminal! Why park the planes miles away - I would much prefer buses. Heathrow generally is a disgrace but this new terminal will make is even worse if that is possible.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,22nd October 2014,unverified,LHR T5 - Washington Dulles 29 Sept returning 14 October. I read the reports about T5 and wonder whether I have travelled to a different Terminal. Yes - there are tons of unnecessary retail outlets (do they ever make any money ?). Yes - there may be a bit of a queue at security. And exactly what airport doesn't have a queue at security in these modern times ? BUT - if you travel to ANY US port of entry (Washington Newark LAX Chicago Miami etc) you will see just how good Terminal 5 actually is. Alright - it's no Changi at Singapore but it's pretty darn good. Going out we had no queue at bag drop a minimal queue at security and found there are plenty of quiet corners to find seats away from the stretch of retails outlets. Coming back on 13th October we had to get the shuttle train to passport control and baggage reclaim but were through the electronic passport control claimed our baggage got our car from the Meet and Greet in the Short Term car park and were on the M25 heading North in 45 minutes. No complaints from me about Heathrow Terminal 5.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Tony Hoare,United Kingdom,22nd October 2014,unverified,Terminal 2 is a nightmare - new terminal that does not deliver! Long! long! walks from aircraft to central area and no airbridge operators 2 out of 4 arrivals in 2 weeks.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Mike Jacques,United Kingdom,13th October 2014,unverified,Transit through Terminal 5 is an ordeal and a dreadful welcome for visitors to our country. The management of passengers through security is nothing short of disgraceful. The airport management at senior level should decide what is more important a stress-free passage for passengers through security or to continue to open more retail outlets. At the moment it appears that the emphasis is to get passengers to spend more at the retail outlets than to establish a stress-free passage through security. With good logistical management this problem could be avoided.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Derek Salter,South Africa,5th October 2014,unverified,Yet another disappointing experience at T5. Arrived at c gates. My connecting flight's gate not yet known. So had to get shuttle to section a. Very busy and like rush hour on the underground. Then waited at section a until gates shown - plenty of seats but seems so full and busy - nowhere pleasant to wait. Why no lounge for paying passengers as at the other terminals? Only BA preferred customers have that facility. Then another shuttle trip to b gates. Limited facilities there and seating around gate areas mediocre. Could learn from other airports which I used on the current trip - Johannesburg and LAX. BA and BAA and T5 not a good advert for wanting to travel via the UK.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,S I Wilson,United Kingdom,30th September 2014,unverified,Heathrow one of the largest airports world-wide and a disgrace short staffed no wheelchairs available for my travelling companion who has trouble walking whilst waiting for the wheelchair we missed our flight to Manchester - leading to a delay of over 4 hours till the next flight We had no problems with Airports in Chicago New York and Las Vegas who where top class. Get your act together Heathrow. And to top my first experience of ever using Heathrow arriving in Manchester my suitcase did not arrive with me. Next time I go direct from Manchester.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Aileen Doherty,United Kingdom,30th September 2014,unverified,Took our son to term 2 last night. Chaos reigned at A counters. One was encouraged to print own bag check etc and then you had to join another queue. The machine would only print one of his boarding passes so he was not allowed to drop bag drop queue he had to join the special assistance queue. 50 minutes later he got to see a person and they checked his bags and printed the second boarding pass. He had checked in online the previous day with Singapore Airlines. Term 2 had grouped all the airlines together and so no individual queues for the airline you were travelling on. It has never been as bad as this in the last 40 years we have travelled through Heathrow. Who's so called bright idea was to lump groups of airlines together. The staff had to keep taking people out of the queues as they were going to miss their flights as the gates close an hour before take off. Shame this lovely new building cannot have proper facilities for the travelling passengers. Everyone says Heathrow is the worst airport in the world so why can they not do something about it. Better management is called for and more staff at busy times is needed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Richard Mac Bride,United States,28th September 2014,unverified,September 22 2014. I had a one hour international connection at T5. Everything went smoothly I was put in the priority line for both immigration and security. I made my connecting flight London-San Francisco with no problems.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,P Terry,United States,28th September 2014,unverified,When flying Virgin Atlantic from Terminal 3 be aware that the gates are a 20 minute walk from the security check point and there are NO food or beverage services at the gates. Layout appears designed to extract the last few pounds before leaving London.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Bill Atkins,United Kingdom,28th September 2014,unverified,Sept 22 early am arrival from the US. I do not think I have cleared any airport I have travelled to faster than this. Zipped through Immigration and Fast Track - was in lounge about 15 minutes after leaving the plane. It can work apparently. The recommendation would have to be for this experience as many were not so good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,W Meadowcroft,United Kingdom,22nd September 2014,unverified,Terminal 5. The security checks carried out by Border Security is just ridiculous disorganised not enough desks open or staff available it was abysmal. We travelled back into the UK from San Francisco at the US end the security checks are more organised quicker and more efficient. They are set up to handle volume not Heathrow T5 it is a joke will not be going there again. Take my advice stay clear use other airlines even go to Amsterdam to go to the US not Heathrow T5.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,C Hall,United Kingdom,22nd September 2014,unverified,Taxis. Anyone wanting a black cab especially late at night not wanting to go into central London beware of the shambles that is the queue for cabs. It is managed but you may find that when it comes to your turn the cabbie won't be interested or will want a fare out of proportion to the journey distance (it's to do with the stupid licensing arrangement they have from TFl's taxis dept) leaving you having wasted your time. The queue operative may approach cabs further down the line - but no guarantee that other drivers will take you either. Seems that a lot don't have card readers in their cabs either. There are private hire taxis in the terminal - my advice is to use one of those instead and it may well be much cheaper.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Kuhan Jandiah Chelvanathan,Malaysia,19th September 2014,unverified,"Transited through LHR to JFK from KUL and the airport has good connections for flights to various parts of the world. However they need to improve on the security screening and its staff. I noticed that the staff were ""selective"" in the passengers who had to undergo additional screening based on stereotypes according to my observation. The transfer desk and security at Terminal 4 could do with some improvements on their tone of voice (when dealing with certain passengers) as well as the building interior itself. Terminal 5 is a nice terminal and is more systematic. Bus transfers were efficient. Free internet limited to 45 minutes only at LHR."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,S I'Anson,United Kingdom,19th September 2014,unverified,Flew from T2 Heathrow to Newark New Jersey and the staff and atmosphere could not have been more different. The T2 staff were polite and helpful (unlike the Newark staff on arrival who were rude and arrogant). There appeared to be an abundance of staff within the duty free area and restaurants who were extremely pleasant and helpful which made for a great start to our city break. Would definitely be happy to fly from this terminal again.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,James Kalat,United States,17th September 2014,unverified,We were changing planes from a flight from South Africa to a flight to the US. We didn't know we would have to go through airport security and I absent-mindedly kept a water bottle in my carry-on. This meant they had to go through every item in my luggage while insulting me for not knowing the rules. They also decided to go through my wife's carry-on because it had an odd-shaped object. But first we had to wait while they went through half a dozen other people's carry-ons extremely slowly occasionally taking a break to do something else. The lady in front of us missed her plane because of the long wait. They seemed to be deliberately slow and deliberately rude. In the future we shall book all our European trips through Amsterdam instead of London.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Brian Hill,United Kingdom,17th September 2014,unverified,T2 to and from Cork. Absolutely no complaints short walk to check-in short walk through security (but there seems to be some problems with the photo ID system - photo taken at entrance caused problems at boarding - no idea why) staff courteous I have a replacement hip but I was dealt with easily. Very quiet in the lounge area - was a Sunday lunchtime a decent selection of places to eat - recommend London's Pride. Lots of seats but what it will be like when fully occupied maybe a problem. Return was easy short if somewhat convoluted walk to the baggage hall no border controls to worry about waited maybe 20 minutes for the baggage to arrive. Then finally short walk to the short stay car park. It is 42 years since I first flew from (the old) T2; but this is how terminals should be.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,T Patrick,Hong Kong,14th September 2014,unverified,T5. Considering the numbers they do a pretty good job. BA strict about not checking in too early (3 hours) but I parked myself at a coffee shop to wait. Lines in ok. Nice food options bit of shopping all clean and tidy. Airport staff positioned in busy areas to help. Gordon Ramsey restaurant is great! I always stop there on route. Security is pretty strict but considering most pax act like they've never left the country (leaving coats on change in pockets etc) they do a good job.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Amanda Takel,United Kingdom,10th September 2014,unverified,Arrived back from Canada yesterday flying into T2 Heathrow. The distances between gate and the border are ridiculous funny how departure seemed easier than arrival. Border lines long as expected but went through the electronic gates which worked but could have done without the three women who were overseeing the gates. They looked very stressed and acted like it. The baggage reclaim however is fundamentally flawed. The baggage carousel does not work. The new system is supposed to stop bags entering the belt electronically stopping bags until there is a space on the belt. If there isn't a space then the bags stop coming up from the handlers below. As the flight had a lot of people waiting to go through the border we stood and waited until someone reclaimed their bags and another one could enter the belt. Eventually a couple of baggage workers arrived and started moving the bags on the belt to make space for other bags. Clearly the bags were being held below and they were trying to sort it out. I chatted with them and it seems that this happens all the time. TIP! Push the bags together if you can you are more likely to get your bags in a decent time frame. Very disappointing.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,L Nieman,United Kingdom,10th September 2014,unverified,Customs queues are some of the slowest I have seen. Terrible. It can be expected to wait up to an hour to get through if you don't have a British passport - and this is coming from someone with permanent residency here.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,10th September 2014,unverified,Flew out of and back into Heathrow for a flight to France. Checked in within under a minute. Short wait at scanners but no queue at immigration on return. Good range of restaurants but very expensive shops as always and terrible queues in WH Smiths.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,S Boyd,United Kingdom,6th September 2014,unverified,Slow slow slow security and passport queues at Heathrow (and we were British Passport holders). Departing LAX everything went smoothly the Americans seem so much better than us at handling airport security and they don't see the need for laptops to be taken out of bags so why do we here in the UK? Long queues here at Heathrow whilst transferring from the inbound international flight to transfer to our domestic departure to Manchester. As a BA customer we were eligible to use the fast track section but that didn't speed things up because the security staff not coping at all well just opened that up to all passengers simply making things worse. One security lady wasn't even able to track which passengers were putting which bags on the x-ray machine belt. If possible don't transfer via Heathrow!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Simon Aglionby,United Kingdom,6th September 2014,unverified,Terminal 2 on day 5 of Turkish Airlines occupation. Had to wait on taxi-way for 20 minutes because our gate was occupied - don't get that there were many unoccupied gates. Our gate was a 20 minute hike to the central areas - given the lack of occupancy would have been nicer if we'd been closer in.. Almost no people around (4pm on a Monday) so no queues at Immigration and the eGates worked well and quickly - maybe 10 seconds to clear Passport control! Then an hour for our luggage. The belt started. Then stopped. Then started again and some bags appeared. But then it stopped again for about half an hour. An engineer came and moved some bags around on the feeders and eventually all was good. A frustrating end to a good week's holiday and a very poor first experience of the new LHR T2. I know they'll fix it in the end but right now I couldn't recommend T2 as a gateway to the world.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Jim Delargy,United Kingdom,1st September 2014,unverified,Terminal 2. We were on a day trip to London for football match. This was our first trip using T2 as Aer Lingus have just moved there from T1. What a shock to find a spacious clean modern terminal! Both arriving and departing were pleasant experiences by airport standards. We had no luggage but security had plenty of open lanes and chatty friendly staff. We had checked in online so have no knowledge of the check in facilities. Plenty of dining options. The only problem was that the signs told us 'please wait' and gave no gate details. It was only when a announcement was made that anyone knew where to go. Apart from that T2 was great and we will not miss the nightmare of T1 with the twenty minute trudge to the backside of nowhere to wait in a glorified tin hut!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,N Kutlesic,Serbia,1st September 2014,unverified,Well this is a very busy airport with a lot of terminals gates facilities and a lot of really interested shops. At our arrival there was a huge queue for visa and passport examination and that should be organised better. Five or six desks didn't work and that number that is present at terminal four just isn't enough for all those people there. Something else that I didn't like was some kind of form that you have to fill in while waiting there are no tables or desks when you can put a pen and form while filling it so you have to fill it in while standing and/or walking in the line. There is no sign that you need to fill that in there are just a few spots to take those forms (and to take them you have to step out of line). After a two-hour long wait we finally finished with that queue and went to baggage claim where again are no signs for which flight is which baggage claim terminal. Fortunately one assistant helped us with that. On flight back home things were much more pleasant everything was quick well-marked there is a lot of duty-free shops and of course there is a lot of stuff members all polite and ready to help. Airport is connected with Tube station by elevator which is well marked and good because a lot of people take the subway. If you are visiting London this is a good airport but if you change your flight Heathrow isn't that good solution maybe Gatwick or even Paris or Brussels airport will be fine.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Pam Walmsley,Australia,1st September 2014,unverified,I have been travelling throughout Europe and UK for 2 months. I have had the misfortune to have had to enter the UK through Heathrow airport. The processing of arrivals is disgraceful and extremely inefficient. On the first occasion it took over an hour to get through UK border. I write this review as I am standing in line for over 1 hour now and I have just reached the sign that tells me it will take at least another half an hour. This is pathetic for a country like the UK to show the world how hopeless you are at organisation . I will never return to the UK through Heathrow again it's a disgrace. It's mid afternoon on Tuesday 26th August 2014 and still Heathrow cannot cope with the people coming to this country in an efficient manner. Never experienced anything like this at any other airport. Wake up and get better. Everywhere else can do it better than you.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Peter Taylor,Australia,1st September 2014,unverified,T3 the check in was good but there it ends once in the hands of the security screening it is nothing short of pathetic. Primary screening is very slow staff seem to keep changing jobs so everything stops while they very leisurely swap positions. There seem to be lots of staff just standing around doing nothing to relieve the chronic congestion and about every third passenger gets picked for secondary hand luggage screen which is manned by just one person so expect about another 30 minutes delay. The large percentage of secondary screening suggests either Heathrow passengers are particularly naive about what is allowed or the screening staff and or the equipment needs a good upgrade because this level of now the manual search I have not experienced anywhere else. I watched this process for some waiting on the change of the guard and it involves every single item being removed in search of I am not sure what because I didn't see anything confiscated. Then a swab is taken and taken to a machine about as far away from the search point as possible so more delay.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,M de Groot,Netherlands,26th August 2014,unverified,On itself T4 isn't too bad however immigration is a nightmare. When these e-passport gates Do not work prepare having to queue for a long time. Airside service in shops can be really bad. Staff really do not care and do they even speak English? The good thing is there's a smokers area!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,David Richey,United States,20th August 2014,unverified,The congestion problem at the security has multiple causes. 1) The gender-gated system of having one male and one female officer to screen persons coming through the gate is wildly inefficient. Any single exceptional case such as an artificial joint leads to that agent being dedicated to that single passenger while every other passenger of the same gender must wait at the gate - this can lead to dozens of one gender just standing there at the scanner gate while the bags pile up at the other end of the belt. Anyone with the slightest math competence can tell you that simply passing on the exceptional passengers to a SEPARATE line and letting the non-exceptional passengers continue would materially enhance passenger flow. Both of my recent times exceeded 30 minutes which gives the lie to their claim to clear 95% in 10 minutes at peak times. 2) It's astonishing that a newish terminal could be designed in such a way that the security lines overwhelm the space available for queuing. Chaotic. 3) The security staff do not seem happy in their work which leads to coarse brittle behavior by them.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,David Arter,Australia,18th August 2014,unverified,Clearing Customs at Terminal 5 was appalling this morning (Monday 18th August 2014). We only had one Customs representative for the first half an hour for both EU and International arrivals! To make matters worse she gave priority to the EU line! When a second customs representative arrived she too gave priority to the EU line making several international arrivals late for their planes. I myself was stopped from going through when an EU customer just happened to arrive. When I chipped them they were very rude and unapologetic. Full marks however to a lovely lady who as a Customs representative tried her level best to ensure people were attended to in order despite their being several queues. This poor lady was visibly embarrassed and quite ashamed of her work colleagues for their rude and unprofessional behaviour.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Kevin Barrance,United Kingdom,15th August 2014,unverified,I'm not sure if I'm particularly lucky or that the reviewers are being particularly picky but I find travelling through T5 remarkably civilised and trouble-free. Went out to Shanghai on 25/7 - an extremely busy day but had no issues at all with check-in or security. No delays. Coming back on 9/8 was the same story - through passport control and a short wait for bags. More than satisfied.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Robert Marshall,United Kingdom,15th August 2014,unverified,Departed London Heathrow (LHR) terminal 2 on 22/07/2014. Arrived terminal 1 12/08/2014. Arrived at T2 over 3 hours before departure. Good signage to indicate check in zones. Check-in for Star Alliance flights is generic and the entire process was chaotic with passengers about to miss their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to a check-in desk. Despite it being the 1st week of school summer holidays and 5 Star Alliance flights checking-in simultaneously not all check-in desks were manned. Check in staff were minimally communicative. Eventually got checked in then came the security 'experience'. Long queues for security. My cabin bag was selected for further checks which required a further long wait as there were several bags selected for further checks and just 1 member of staff doing this - in the 1st week of school summer holidays! The additional security checks on my back-pack must have taken about 40 minutes by the time the 1 member of staff got to my bag had checked everything swabbed everything put the swab through the ionmiser re-xrayed everything and then I had to re-pack everything. Eventually completed security clearance had a quick trip to the toilets (clean) and got to departure gate with about 10 minutes to spare. At departure gate a sullen non-communicative member of ground handling staff. Airbridge was broken so down two flights of stairs and walk to aircraft. On arrival on 12/08 after spending an extraordinary amount of time going around in circles above London we eventually landed followed by a very long taxi to airbridge. Good signage in terminal. Clean and plentiful toilets. Very long walk to T1 UK border from where aircraft parked. Reasonable queues at UK border handled by pleasant UK border staff. Baggage reclaim no problems as baggage already on carousel when we got there. The final insult: sitting in the grid-locked traffic at about 22:45 outside of T1 car park for about 15 minutes wondering why we're not moving. My advice: if departing T2 get there at least 3 hours before hand (preferably more) and hope that you can just about make it to your flight or better yet avoid LHR T2 if at all possible.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,C Schaefer,Switzerland,15th August 2014,unverified,"Terminal 1 - Bag Drop. 10 Aug 17.00 hr - horribly long queue - we could not believe what we saw in a ""modern"" airport. It takes 45 minutes plus just for bag drop. Staff told us it is always like this. Just awful! After this long wait a very long walk to departure gate which was in Terminal 2."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Brian Smith,Spain,10th August 2014,unverified,"Connection from T3 to T5 at 0600 on a Friday. Inbound flight was delayed 75 mins leaving 30-odd minutes from aircraft door opening to gate opening at T5. Knowing Heathrow I was not at all confident of making it - indeed I assumed we wouldn't. Flight connections signing was good and the transfer area was actually quite efficient with buses seemingly frequent although a painfully slow journey it did take the promised 10 minutes. Into T5 and a bit of quick thinking got us into the fast-track at the id check saving 10 minutes queuing time. Security was not very busy but was very slow although staff were polite enough. Passengers seemed mostly at fault for the speed of things as only about 1 in 5 makes any effort to ""get ready"" leading to lots of opening and rummaging for things in bags before the x-ray. A sprint down to gate A10 and another bus journey took us back where we'd just come from but we'd made the connection - in something like 40 minutes plane to plane. However it felt like it was despite not because of the airport."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Gillian Gaunt,United Kingdom,7th August 2014,unverified,I was picking a foreign language student up from LHR on Sunday 20th July. The flight was from Berlin. It was chaos! Obviously the airport must have been aware that this was one of the busiest times for them as hundreds of foreign schools were waiting to collect English Language students to go to schools all over the country. We arrived at 13.00. Our student's flight was listed to arrive at 13.50. After about an hor the flight disappeared from the screen. We eventually found someone to ask and he said it was delayed. The passengers were all taking at least two hours to pick up their luggage! We eventually left the airport about six o'clock and parking had cost us a fortune. What s going on at London Airport? What an example to foreign visitors!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,C Era,United States,7th August 2014,unverified,Arrived mid morning from DFW at T3 on American Airlines. Disembarkation was fast we were through immigration in no time with all desks manned and luggage on belt within 10 mins of us getting through border control. Extremely fast and efficient as has always been my experience at Heathrow in recent years.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,D Parker,Australia,3rd August 2014,unverified,We were held up going through security and when a bag was side-tracked as being 'suspicious' were forced to wait quite a while as they were 'rotating' - the desk was un-manned for several minutes between 'shifts' and a queue of people was developing. Staff are obviously busy but their surly approach does not make for a comfortable time. Also the body scanner seemed completely out of kilter as it kept on alerting even though I was wearing cotton underclothes and cotton on top - no metal at all. They suggested that my glasses were the problem but they are plastic frames. The staff person on decided then to re-calibrate it but it was totally unnecessary to be exposed to that as there was no good reason for it. We also noticed a lack of facilities - after a long day leading up to our arrival at the airport we were surprised and disappointed to find that there are no shower or washing facilities available - only the normal toilets which are not suitable for the purpose.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,H Davies,United Kingdom,31st July 2014,unverified,LHR is a national disgrace. Travelled to T1 from Marseille on several Sunday evenings this year. Almost every arrival has been poor including baggage delay of 30 minutes because of the 'arrival of several aircraft ' (there's a surprise) stranded on the plane for over 30 minutes because there were no steps no gate available. On most occasions arrival involves disembarking into the terminal and then back out again and on to a bus. Is this really how an international airport should be run? This is not a four star airport - just look at the reviews.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Mark Evans,United Kingdom,31st July 2014,unverified,Our LOT flight ex-WAW landed punctually and taxied to the gate at 21.40 but LHR ground staff did not appear for fully 15 minutes. The exasperated flight attendant said this was typical. Once let off the plane we found ourselves in a deserted T2 but were routed to T1 for passport control and baggage reclaim - a walk of a further 15+ minutes. To reinforce the joy of the BAA experience at LHR I then paid the extortionate GBP 23 for a one-way Heathrow Express ticket to Paddington.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Siti Robinson,Singapore,29th July 2014,unverified,Was travelling back to Singapore after a 2 week holiday in UK and Paris. We took 5 flights to and from T5 during our holiday. This last one was our 6th flight. We were all very tired when we got to the airport. We arrived with 3 hours to spare. We tried using the self service check in kiosk even though it never worked on our previous flights. Of course this time it didn't work again. So off we went to counter B1 for assistance. There were only 3 groups before us in that queue so we thought it won't take us long. How wrong we were. One group took 5-10 mins which was ok but the second one took over 50 mins. To make matters worse after this group finally left the staff at the counter attended to a big group which wasn't even in the queue. Of course we were not happy and moved away. My husband decided to ask the staff at self service check in kiosk to help us check in. She was attending to my husband when my kids and I joined him. She had obviously checked in some of us and then asked for the passport of the fourth person without telling me who she has already checked in because I wasn't there. I gave her the wrong passport and that's when she started talking to me condescendingly. She threatened not to proceed with checking me in. By that time my kids and husband had already been checked in I had a lot more to say to her but had to hold my tongue as all I wanted was to be checked in and get on my flight. Were finally checked in after 1.5 hrs. Just as well we arrived early. I am so shocked with how bad the service is and how the staff can get away with it. Of course our BA flight to Singapore was delayed like all other flights that we took during our holiday. This time it was delayed for 3 hours. 2 hours of that we were stuck in the plane. Have promised ourselves not to fly BA in the future if it means going through T5. Worst experience ever.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Michael Brady,Australia,29th July 2014,unverified,We arrived at Terminal 4 amidst a downpour and our taxi dropped us off at the drop zone. Having paid him an exorbitant fee for the fare because the M25 was clogged up we were then exposed to the torrential rain in the time it took us to find a trolley and wheel all our luggage up to the terminal doors. By the time we got there we were all soaked to the skin. I looked around and discovered we had no chance of seeking any cover or protection from the weather as there wasn't any until you reached the terminal. Surely this is ridiculous as winter rain would be just as bad. Not happy at all. I for one will be avoiding Heathrow in the future not only because of this but the M25 is a continual joke.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Dagmar Byers,United States,27th July 2014,unverified,We traveled through Heathrow on 7/18/14 passing through from Stuttgart on our way to Dallas. Due to a late arrival our connection time was shortened to a little over an hour. We transferred easily from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3 although it takes about 15 minutes by bus to do so. However the security screening at Terminal 3 was completely unacceptable. First of all there were only 2 lines open. Secondly once it was our turn our bags were placed into a tub and then abandoned. Simply left on the belt and everyone walked away. I asked several times for someone to process us and was told someone was on their way. Several security personnel were simply standing around doing nothing. I then went to the supervisor's desk and demanded that someone process us. He told me to stop shouting at him and that he had dispatched someone. Again we waited. I explained again that we had a flight to catch. No one was interested in the least in this. Then an agent took our tub and moved it forward to a table. Then another agent came. All these agents moved at snail speed. It was like a bad movie. No one was friendly not to mention displayed any sense of urgency whatsoever. The agent then carried our tub very slowly to another desk and proceeded to review our bags. We had a pasta machine brand new unopened in the box. This then needed to be taken apart examined it might have been a weapon and only when yet another agent a supervisor and the only person with any sense in that whole bunch said that it was ok were we permitted to pack everything up and proceed. I was absolutely furious. We were on our way to Dallas and arriving in the US was a breath of fresh air everyone there was friendly we processed quickly. The staff in London should be ashamed. This is the absolutely worst airport ever. They really could not have cared less.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,J Tung,United Kingdom,27th July 2014,unverified,"Departed from Terminal 2 on EVA air. Was excited to visit the new airport with high hopes it would be like T5 but what a great disappointment. The check in area was airy but not as grand as T5. It's clean and basic. There were only two cafes/bar before security - A Costa and a Weatherspoon. There is also a very tiny travel shop. When we entered the check in area it was empty - not many airlines have moved to T2. There was a very polite and friendly gentleman from the airport at the entrance to give you direction and guidance. I assume because it's not occupied solely by one airlines like T5 does the check in desks seem to be more ""traditional"" and less inviting. Most of the airlines are using self check in and bag tag printing service which might save time for some but not for all. Perhaps the airport was still new and not used by many airlines and we also arrived very early the check in was very smooth and fast. Security was also fast but it will be interesting to see what happens when all airlines move in. The check in agent warned us its a long walk to get to the gate. It turned out to be a reasonable walk just a lot of stairs/escalators going up and down. There are not many dining and shopping options in the terminal either. The signature restaurant was a big disappointment. Food was boring and plain. Shopping is also very weak. All in all it's a clean and new airport. If you are flying short haul with no requirement for check in or eating/drinking/shopping it might work well."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,A Peterson,United Kingdom,20th July 2014,unverified,"Travelled with Air Canada from the brand new LHR terminal 2. We checked in online the day before our flight and had our electronic boarding passes and arrived at terminal 2 expecting to just drop our bags off as per usual. Upon arrival we informed quite rudely that even though we had already checked in and had our boarding passes we still had to use a self service machine to obtain our baggage tags and then drop our bags off. So we used the machines and my partners passport wouldn't scan properly so he could not get his baggage tags. We were told by the assistant that it was probably because the surname was too long on the passport (strange reason) and that in order to get a baggage tag we had to join the ""check in assistance"" line which was huge and check in his bags there. I was also told that because I had my baggage tags I had to join a different line and drop my bags off there because as I had already printed my baggage tags I would not be allowed to drop off my bags at check in assistance with my partners bags - cue Benny Hill music. So I dropped my bags off and then rejoined my partner in his line turns out a lot of people were having having problems with the self service machines not reading people's passports properly. After 30 minutes wait we eventually reached the counter and explained the situation to the agent who was so rude and basically said ""not my fault the machines don't read your passport and that we should complain to Air Canada"". So in the old terminal 3 you checked in online and dropped your bags off but in the new brand sparkly terminal 2 you still have to use the self service machines and proceed to drop off but god help you if the machines don't work because the staff will not help you!"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Rachel Finner,United States,20th July 2014,unverified,"I have flown from the US to Europe many times and my experience at London Heathrow Airport was horrible. The airport itself was difficult and to top it off having to deal with the ""lady"" at security was a nightmare. As I said before this is not my first time flying to Europe or even a London airport. The treatment I received while going through security was disrespectful and flat out rude. I realize security at airports are in some regards different but when you are being talked about while you are less than two feet away from this ""lady"" as if you are stupid is reprehensible and to be called a ""moaner"" and being accused of ""moaning"" about the security procedures because you are from the USA. As my bag finally made it through security I was standing in front of the metal detector she says ""I hope you have a nice flight and forces a smile. I looked at her and replied ""I will once I get out of here."" This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at an airport and if I have any control over flying through London or staying in London I will never fly through London Heathrow again."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,JK Nageldinger,United States,12th July 2014,unverified,What were they thinking when they designed this airport? Having everyone walk a gauntlet of high priced shops through a narrow corridor pulling luggage is just plain stupid. Inadequate and confusing signage throughout. Complete lack of information kiosks. At the entrance to some of the escalators there were barriers that forced you to turn sideways to pull your roller board through. Seating in the waiting area only a very small percentage of seats could view the departure monitors. The degree of walking waiting and confusion is equalled only by some airports in 3rd world countries. This was one of the most frustrating and ill conceived airports I have ever been in. For shame England. Is the really the best you could do?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,J MacNamara,United Kingdom,8th July 2014,unverified,Landed at what was meant to be T1 on 1st July and it turned out to be T2 which isn't meant to have opened yet with no warning took a full 25 minutes to walk to immigration including coming to a huge flight of stairs with no esclator up which people just had to pull their luggage. Nobody was on hand to tell us it would be anything like this far (I'm mildly mobility impaired and have a limit of about 10 minutes for walking - had I known I might have been able to pace it better). Only one toilet passed in all this time which was a tiny '2 seater' with a big queue and in a poor state so just had to persevere. Usually I use T5 last time 27th June and next time 8th July which is generally marginally cleaner but also involves yomping huge distances gates which are 20 minutes away by the underground transit but only announced at the last moment and glacially slow queues for security and immigration where we are all treated like cattle. Even the escalators are slow. The one thing they have lots of is highly priced 'duty free' shops. Don't expect any bargains - it's like looking at sales on Bond Street: 10% off doesn't really help when the thing was marked up 50% in the first place. Few airports are fun but this really gives a poor impression of this country to visitors. Staff can make a huge difference - every now and then I meet someone helpful (like BA's Mr Law who helped me last month when my daughter was flying out to China from T5 and got downgraded by BA despite a full fare ticket) and would encourage them all (security staff immigration airline and service providers) just please to try to treat people as they would want their visiting granny to be treated.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,A Dobson,United Kingdom,8th July 2014,unverified,I have been flying through LHR Terminal 5 two to four times per month for the last 11 months and would have continued to do so for the next year. However my experiences at T5 have been dreadful - long queues for Border Control and Security. So much so that I cannot rely on two hours being sufficient to get from an inbound international flight to a domestic connection. Border Control staff are impassive and unhelpful but BAA staff are downright rude inefficient and ill-informed. Schiphol can manage 45 minutes gate to gate - are very friendly and obviously want my business. Likewise Newark. It is obvious that the Border and Security facilities at T5 are inadequate for the numbers passing through but a look at other airports would show that significant improvements could be made with little investment - moving a barrier here; moving a machine there; better training and utilization of the existing facilities and staff.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,L Murphy,United Kingdom,6th July 2014,unverified,Rude Security staff really awful avoid! Treated like a herded animal staff are just so rude! Avoid Terminal 3 at all costs!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Peter Fitzgerald,New Zealand,6th July 2014,unverified,Dirty crowded expensive and inefficient. A microsome of most things in London. Nicely reflects what to expect from England as a visitor.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,B Harris,Australia,3rd July 2014,unverified,"This is the worst airport I have travelled through. I have travelled the world extensively and have never encountered such rudeness or disorganisation. We travelled with British Airways (who were fine) and were using Heathrow as a transit stop only (this time). Despite being in transit we waited in multiple queues and 2 hours into our transit with only 1 hour to go I asked a staff member ""Are we going to make this flight"". The response was simply ""No"". There was no help either to make the flight or to help us if we missed the flight there was no apology and there was no express queue available to people with short transit times. The staff in general were highly rude un-helpful and despite there being a lot of staff members they were standing around doing nothing. There was only one security check station open lots of redundant staff members and copious amounts of travellers standing around for 2-3 hours waiting to get through. Unless you are actually wanting to enter London do not transit through Heathrow CDG is a much better choice and the staff are delightful. If you need to enter London I would seriously consider flying into CDG anyway and then getting the Channel Tunnel Train."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Ken Gibson,United Kingdom,3rd July 2014,unverified,Transferred from T1 to T3 on 24 May and T3 to T1 on 8 June. Bit of a nightmare - lots of walking backwards and forwards - down one long corridor and then back up to same one separated by a glass partition pretty unhelpful staff several of whom did not seem to know where to direct us. One person fairly aggressively claimed we were going the wrong way and wanted to turn us back when we wanted to enter flight connections (we did have the right to go there) - a less experienced traveller could easily have accepted his reprimand found themselves land side and had to recheck in and pass security and maybe missing their flight. Also inter terminal bus journey not comfortable or pleasant. Would only recommend if no alternative existed (or being the optimist if the new T2 makes things a lot better).
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,S Kapusta,United States,30th June 2014,unverified,Not the worst airport in Europe but giving Paris CDG a run for the bottom place. June 26 the luggage system is down all officials concerned with acting stuffy and official not in helping. Security staff that confuse inefficiency with thoroughness BA their usual incompetent selves (is this what unionizing does to customer service?). A place to avoid at all costs! Plus most public space is taken up by expensive duty free a clear misnomer.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,J Carroll,United States,25th June 2014,unverified,Arrived from US at 6.40 am on June 11 with no checked luggage on my way to London and didn't get through Border Control until 8.25 am. It took over 45 minutes to get to the sign that said that we could expect to wait 45 minutes from that point. There appeared to be only two agents checking in our very long line until 8 am when more agents arrived and after chatting obliviously behind the check-in stations for a bit started speeding things up. This wait time was even worse than the 1 hour+ wait when I visited in 2012. My last trip to the UK went through Heathrow and ended in Edinburgh where the Border Control experience was much more reasonable. This experience was disgraceful.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,C Knapman,United Kingdom,25th June 2014,unverified,Whilst my own experience with Heathrow was relatively pain free I felt quite ashamed at what I was witnessing happening to other people transiting through the airport. I was connecting from a flight arriving at Terminal 3 to a domestic departure from Terminal 5. The bus transfer between the terminals was pain free and just involved a lot of walking. It was the Border controls and security that had me quite ashamed of what for some people is the only view they get of the UK. I moved through the EU passport border quite quickly but witnessed a large queue for the International passport border trapped with a very rude member of staff not explaining why they were there all of them getting visibly upset and all this staff member would do is tell them to be quiet and wait with no clear view of what they were waiting for. The border agency staff seemed stressed which isn't reassuring. Moving onto security well this was a shambles the staff were not explaining what some passengers should do and then being very rude if they went through the scanners with a belt on the bag scanners were incredibly slow with large build up of people waiting for the bag to come through the other side all the time the staff just seemed to stand there and do nothing looking incredibly bored like it was some kind of torture to be there. We all know Heathrow is under a lot of strain but sorting out the border and security would make it a lot more pleasant experience to pass through.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,L Hulland,United Kingdom,25th June 2014,unverified,Terminal 4 was yet again a nightmare for me. Being disabled with breathing problems I had asked for a wheelchair from the plane. I had flown in from Goa via Mumbai and had no problems and so much help until yet again I reached Heathrow. No wheelchairs and about a dozen or so people waiting for help. Eventually some buggies came and I was told the chair would meet me at immigration. How wrong that was. From there I was left to struggle through immigration baggage reclaim and customs. I asked why the chairs were not there and was told they don't have enough and couldn't find any. At least it was better than last time on the 25th February. Then there were no wheelchairs or trolleys and they couldn't find them as they were all outside. I was left to struggle and no help whatsoever. Disgusted with Heathrow Terminal 4. Very poor customer service.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,M Jacques,United Kingdom,25th June 2014,unverified,Visited terminals 4 and 5 and found travel between the terminals though not as a transit passenger easy and efficient. Terminal and BA staff extremely helpful with all enquiries.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,R Tompkins,United Kingdom,25th June 2014,unverified,Terminal 5: Over 1 hour to get through FastTrack security. Mainly as a result of 2 passengers breaching every rule in the book but having just 1 security person to deal with each queue is ridiculous. Fortunately my flight was delayed 2 hours but others must have been in danger of missing. Very crowded in the shopping areas and limited seating. Much better at departure gates. Return queues for immigration dreadful. Snaked back to the stairs entering the hall. They have allowed way too many people to use this place. Cannot be good for business as nobody has time to spend any money in the shops or bars.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,J Gifford,United States,23rd June 2014,unverified,Impossibly long queuing in Terminal 5 international connections every time - at least one and quarter from arrival to gate of departing flight. No time for shopping dining without angst. 4 times through and still not clearly organized traffic flow backed up to exit from arriving gate etc. Anyway this might be improved with better foot traffic flow management? Otherwise abominable.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,B Landers,Hong Kong,13th June 2014,unverified,"I too will try to avoid Heathrow in future. My bags got caught up in the June 6th baggage system ""IT issue"" and I still have no word on them one week later. They were to have been delivered on June 8th to Rome but then BA cancelled that flight and no one at Rome airport or at Heathrow seems to know what happened to them even as I was leaving Rome to return to London. Then my connection back to London was cancelled with only a message to ""ring if you want to re-book"" - totally unacceptable given that I had a connection from LHR to Dulles and it was clearly visible in the system. I am Emerald One World and am on a Business Class Round the World ticket and that is the treatment? I will try to go via other airports and avoid BA in future."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,S C Adcock,United Kingdom,13th June 2014,unverified,Arrived T4 to collect relative on flight from China. Heathrow and airline live boards online both showed plane on time at 15.25. Flight arrival board shows expected 17.56! Over a two hour delay. We are now stuck at airport paying exorbitant parking fees for probably 3 hours. There is no desk to complain to. Just told by member if staff to register a complaint online. The web was updated at 15.40. Did they suddenly realise the plane was missing? Not good enough Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,K Champion,South Africa,8th June 2014,unverified,Terminal 1. Totally under-staffed at the security area. We waited 40 minutes as they pulled both our hand luggage off. One staff member and they were checking nearly every passenger with a carry on suitcase. Very slowly. 25 minute walk to our SAA flight. Why on earth would you move the gate to Terminal 2 when it is not open. Disgraceful. 2 hours to check in clear security and get to the gate. No-one checked our passports until we boarded the plane. T5 is far more efficient.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Kevin Barrance,United Kingdom,5th June 2014,unverified,T5 returning from Mumbai. Was out of the plane through immigration collected bags and was in my car in the car park within 45 minutes. How good is that! I think it's one of the those places where your view is governed entirely based to the specific experience you had on your last trip. For me it was perfect.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Jane Buch,United Kingdom,4th June 2014,unverified,The first toilets on landing at Terminal 3 were an absolute disgrace - filthy overloaded bins dryer not working locks on doors broken. One of our party is disabled and required assistance which was ok from the plane to Terminal 3 but then left in lounge with no idea of when she would be collected and taken to passport control and to collect her luggage. We were unable to help her as no one had any idea of how to contact the disabled lounge. She eventually hobbled out on her own and was rescued by passport control. I will never use Heathrow again.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,B Aldridge,United States,4th June 2014,unverified,Heathrow is in short a mess. Getting around is a confusing mishmash of walkways corridors escalators and busses. Signage is clear but the airport is nevertheless extremely difficult to navigate efficiently. I have never seen so many people racing through a terminal apparently trying to navigate the complicated layout numerous times to find where they should be. I am fortunate to usually travel business class so I can avoid the cavernous dirty hot noisy and smelly main waiting areas in favor of a private airline lounge. The terminals seem to be organized to generate sales at the stores and restaurants and not for passenger comfort or convenience. Immigration lines are very long and extremely slow which seems to be a problem at airports everywhere. For anyone changing to a domestic flight I would recommend at least 3 hours transit time. Several times baggage claim has been a single carousel serving many flights crowded with hundreds of people. The ensuing chaos makes for understandably frayed nerves and short tempers. Did I mention the airport is dirty? I have noticed on the London subway that the locals just leave trash everywhere but in trash cans and they do the same at Heathrow. Unfortunately it appears to be picked up infrequently.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Albert Herskovits,United Kingdom,3rd June 2014,unverified,"Arrived at Terminal One Heathrow 1.30 pm 1 June 2014 . Seemed like a 2 mile walk to immigration long wait then half a mile walk to baggage reclaim. Small room and 300+ people waiting around a single carousel. Had to wait 60 minutes for baggage to come off and at first only 1 bag every 30 seconds or so. Explanation for wait was that there were ""staff problems."" No other explanation forthcoming. This airport is an absolute disgrace! Filthy dirty airport heat stifling. Took 90 minutes to collect my bag. Staff non-existent. My partner is disabled and almost fainted. I will never fly out of this airport again."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,26th May 2014,unverified,MAN-LHR-BKK return. The facilities in T5 are good with several restaurants and a reasonably priced Wetherspoons bar (albeit the bar has a limited seating area for those purchasing drinks and not food). Its a bit bizarre that the smaller Wetherspoons bar in T5b has 4 times the seating. The free wifi is very slow and intermittent worked much better on outward than inward journey. The outbound transit was very quick and efficient. However offsetting this was the usual amount of time to exit/enter Heathrow on the plane - outbound delayed 50 minutes inbound by 30 minutes. Arriving at T5 transfers on 25 May was a disgrace - 1 officer having to deal with fasttrack EU and non EU nationals. No movement at all for 15 minutes. Staff co-ordinator realised eventually situation should be being resolved and eventually 2 more officials came out to assist. My non EU partner was held up briefly as well when eventually seen but issue then resolved swiftly. Heathrow needs to address staffing issues correctly and efficiently and review policy of no pay as you go lounge in T5 as some passengers enjoy the experience before the flight.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Fred Quint,Switzerland,26th May 2014,unverified,Arriving at Terminal 5 to transit from Geneva to Phoenix. Delayed 1 hour due to windy conditions. Extremely slow waiting time at the security check. Useless steward was calling gates for every single passenger to check whether it was closed instead of grouping passengers in priority order. We had to explain her to make sure we could catch the flight. As usual poor transit conditions and poor communications/service. I will make sure I avoid transiting via LHR as much as possible.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,21st May 2014,unverified,Terminal 5 LHR Fast Track Security is an absolute shambles we waited for over 45 minutes to get through Fast Track last Monday 19 May I know security are not part of British Airways but really it does make you think twice about using T5. I appreciate there is a need for security but when they are just standing around talking & appear to be in no rush I guess it makes TSA look good. British Airways need to be aware that the poor customer service is a reflection on them so they do need to ensure there is a level of customer service set in line with their excellent customer service BA provide. The other area which is annoying is the amount of walking to go from Fast Track which is next to the BA Lounge to then walk halfway down the terminal only to double back on yourself. We all know it is a ploy to get passengers to walk through the numerous shopping outlets which the majority of business passengers ignore so come on BA & BAA allow the business passenger direct access to the BA Lounges next to Fast Track as most of us have no interest in buying anything from the shops in T5.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Jeremie Martin,France,13th May 2014,unverified,Queuing time for security check on Sunday 12 May was unacceptable. Extremely long especially for a connection flight. Hundreds of staff but what a poor organisation. On top of that luggage was lost. Next time I'll do my best to avoid connecting at Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Henson,United Kingdom,6th May 2014,unverified,Arrival at LHR Terminal 3 on 6 May 2014. Arrived at Terminal 3 on a Virgin Atlantic flight from San Francisco. Terminal 3 was clean and bright but still looks relatively outdated in parts compared to other facilities at Heathrow and other comparable large hub airports. Relatively short line for passport control. Clean toilets. Short wait for suitcase. Large presence of ground handling agents. Greater presence of customs agent than I had seen for a while which actually offers some reassurance. T3 arrivals landside (including certain retailers) has a very crowded and scruffy feel I do hope this will be the focus of forthcoming renovation and development work. Relatively long walk to Underground station but this is to be expected at an airport of this size and the trains are frequent from the T1/2/3 station.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,P Cullen,United Kingdom,5th May 2014,unverified,I have used terminals 4 and 5 for flights in the past 3 months. Departure from both was pretty good with short queues for check-in and security though the scanners at Heathrow seem more sensitive than anywhere else I have been - everybody seems to set them off. Arriving is not so good with lengthy queues for passport checks as others have mentioned the scanners are painfully slow. Buses to and from long stay car parks seem to work well. My main gripe is that on both occasions having landed we were kept on the taxiway for 20-30 minutes as 'we are waiting for the gate to be vacated'. It also happened to my daughter (T5). It is frustrating that on a short flight you can spend as much time getting off the aircraft as you have in the air and on a long flight the last thing you want having arrived is to sit in your seat for another half hour. I know Heathrow is a large and very busy airport but this problem has to be addressed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,C Denson,United Kingdom,5th May 2014,unverified,3 hours from landing to arriving home in Croydon - a distance of no more than 20 miles as the crow flies! Landed at terminal 5 after flying in from Chicago. Long wait for buses before we could get off the plane. Queues at passport control - how is it that the electronic machines for automatically reading passports take so long to work if they work so no one wants to use them? Once I'd collected baggage the real fun started. My options to get to Croydon are train Paddington then underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (complicated and train is expensive) underground to Victoria and train to Croydon (slow and engineering work meant no circle or district line services to Victoria) or bus direct from Heathrow to Croydon (1.5 hours but direct and cheap). How to get to central bus station? Signage in Terminal 5 is confusing and unhelpful. Man on info desk in Term 5 gave me incorrect info. Finally establish I need to get a train from Term 5 to Term 2/3 and train only runs every 15 minutes. Is this a 3rd world airport in the middle of the night? No its London Heathrow middle of day on Bank Holiday weekend. Why is there no free regular shuttle like the one between North and South Terminals in Gatwick? After an overnight flight the whole experience of landing at Term 5 was frustrating stressful and unpleasant. Lesson learned - wherever possible I'll avoid this airport in future. If you live in south London its a nightmare.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,N Barnsley,Spain,23rd April 2014,unverified,Terminal 5. Minimal queues at passport control on arrival and bags waiting on the belt likewise at check-in and security on departure. Short walking distances from / to gates and short distance to the underground are bonuses. Staff are generally friendly courteous and efficient. Great views of the apron and the runways from the departure lounge which is relaxed light and airy with lots of seating. Lots of shops and restaurants too but we didn't visit any of them.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,22nd April 2014,unverified,T1 outgoing 8th April returning 17th April LHR-VIE-TLV and return. Cons: the 'outer' gates are a full 15 minutes from the main area and the facilities in the outer reaches are quite lacking. Pros: the e-gates for returning UK/EEA nationals are now in place and save a lot of queuing time as a result. Security on the outgoing leg was fairly prompt. Overall: the new T2 can't come soon enough.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,M Riley,United States,22nd April 2014,unverified,Make sure to look at your boarding passes to determine whether or not you have luggage to claim (I think if you are flying the same airline both flights your luggage goes to your destination). When I landed at Heathrow we were not given any directions or instructions about what we were to do next. Being an inexperienced traveler I assumed that I needed to pick up luggage so I followed the signs toward baggage claim. After standing in line for at least 10 minutes I realized that my baggage had already been sent to the next flight. The annoying thing was that nobody mentioned this to me. After baggage claim I must have made a wrong turn and got completely lost. The layout of the airport can be very confusing and there seems to be a lack of signage in some areas. I asked several employees for help and no one could put me in the right direction. Trying to find my way through this airport was like running through an endless maze. By the time I reached the boarding gate I had just missed my flight by about 5 mins. I went to the counter to have them put me on the next flight. Told it was my fault and had to charge me $275. The return trip was much easier because I knew that I didn't have to pick up luggage and I was with a group of people so that made it easier. As soon as we got off the plane there was an information display listing terminals according to the airlines so it was simply a matter of following signs to the terminal and departure gate. How did I miss this on my first trip? Where was the information display or clear signs in the baggage area? I guess I simply took the longer confusing route. I suppose some terminals may be smaller or easier to navigate then others. There are some nice restaurants and shops and the flights were pleasant but I will still try to avoid this airport in the future after this awful experience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Simon Darnbrough,United Kingdom,16th April 2014,unverified,I really feel sorry for British Airways at T5 as they have an otherwise excellent terminal ruined by Security and Immigration which are out of their control. Having flown in on a BA flight from Geneva and departing to Manchester had to queue through the transit immigration desks rather than the electronic gates which took 20 minutes as only manned by 1 official despite there being 4 other channels! Then the joys of Heathrow security queuing for 15 minutes and then being told the equipment had broken and join the back of another queue for another 15 minute wait. I know security and immigration aren't the most interesting jobs around but some pretence at being human wouldn't go amiss as this is the first impression of the UK that most visitors get. Once inside the terminal is excellent!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Dave Houlihan,United Arab Emirates,13th April 2014,unverified,I have to agree with previous comments for many years I used LHR from the ME en-route to Dublin. I found the Immigration a farce waiting for hours even though I was transiting through why I should have to clear immigration is beyond me. More security checks  again if I am a transit passenger why should I? I have already cleared security in my departure point. Last but not least from immigration to bitter rude and ignorant staff at security. I have never come across such unprofessional staff in any airport and fly monthly. Shameful for the entry point to the UK as it is great country with super people luckily Emirates now fly direct so no more LHR for me. A blessing.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,C Brown,United Kingdom,11th April 2014,unverified,Having read some of the reviews for Heathrow Airport one could be left thinking that the UK's hub airport is a third world disgrace. My experiences however are quite the opposite. I've flown from LHR a few times over the last couple of years and my last trip was to and from Terminal 5 in April 2014. The terminal building is light airy and clean. Everything is well sign-posted and there's a good choice of landslide coffee shops restaurants and pubs. Along with a pharmacy bureaux de change and other amenities. Although there are plenty of staff on hand I would say that the queuing system for check-in needs an overhaul. Despite being able to check-in at any desk one is left to queue at each desk individually; if a problem arises with a passenger in front then you are stuck waiting for that check-in agent whilst other passengers on surrounding desks move to the front. Despite some reviews I have always found the security process through to the departures lounge to be very quick and professional. On my latest trip I waited around 30 seconds. You can tell that the airport authority has invested a lot of money on the screening equipment used. I don't know whether some passengers aren't used to stringent security but I feel reassured and have never encountered a rude member of security staff. In fact I've found them to be both approachable and friendly. Terminal 5 is a giant shopping mall it has to be said - and an expensive one at that. But the fantastic panoramic views and beautiful sunlight coming through the expansive windows is enough to compensate for the commercialism. There's a good choice of bars and eateries. Unlike some other terminals at Heathrow you don't have to walk nearly as far to get to your gate but be warned - If you are travelling from gates marked 'B' or 'C' then you have to get an underground shuttle train to a satellite terminal and this can take 15 minutes. On arrival back to the UK I was through immigration in a couple of minutes and had my luggage a few minutes after that. Back in the arrivals hall and then onto the Heathrow Express - an (incredibly) expensive but convenient way to get from airport to city in less than half an hour.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,R Fleming,United States,10th April 2014,unverified,"If you have respiratory ailments or allergies do not fly through or use London Heathrow! I have only mild allergies and had a two hour layover at London Heathrow. To and from my gate and from security check I was forced to walk past huge perfume displays with the scents wafting throughout the airport and terminal. I went to sit beside a ""fresh"" air vent only to discover there was perfume coming out of the vent! When I finally was called to my gate I had no choice but to walk through yet another gauntlet of perfume being sprayed around in a store that was open to the concourse. It ruined my trip and I will never use London Heathrow again. Customs was complete chaos. One agent would tell you to put everything back in your bag and the next agent would ask everyone to remove it again."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,T Turner,United Kingdom,6th April 2014,unverified,"Had a transfer within Heathrow on 31 March 2014 which involved a security check from Terminal 5 into Terminal 3. The female security officer was officious and rude and the final straw was her comment ""if you don't like it don't fly"". What an appalling attitude. I usually fly from Manchester Airport where the security staff are friendly and extremely courteous and I hope never to have to use Heathrow again after this experience."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,David Grainger,Kenya,30th March 2014,unverified,T5 Immigration. I flew in from Cape Town on 28th March. The lines of people at immigration was a disgrace. We shuffled for ages in the EU passport line. It would have been faster not having an EU passport. Staff were slow and there seamed to be no urgency in clearing the hall that totally filled up. All the staff do is scan a passport not hard. The UK Govt should be ashamed of itself. You get though far quicker in third world nations where they do more than just scan your passport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Marshall,United Kingdom,28th March 2014,unverified,I was very annoyed with the immigration controls this morning when arriving from Sydney via Singapore on a BA flight that arrived at 4.45 am. When we arrived at passport control there was not one single person to speak to. Many passengers were getting connecting flights and looked so confused. They were just left to read the electronic boards. Surely someone should have been on duty to help these passengers. Then as we approached the Passport control area several big flights had obviously come in at the same time but as we had electronic passports we thought we would be okay and would get through quickly. Wrong! UK and EU citizens were all herded into one area and it was not clear that the EPassport area was not available but we did finally see a small A4 sheet of paper which said that the epassport scanners were not operational until 5.30 am. It was 5.20 am so decided to stay in the long queue although some people started queuing for the epassport section. There were two female attendants to the right of this area and when I approached them to ask if I could go through with my epassport I was told quite sternly that I should join the large queue to my left. Then another official came on the scene and looked confused at the large queues and then proceeded to check the scanners and eventually invited people to use the escanners. However these did not appear to work properly because they were not giving any messages out. When one guy removed his passport because it didn't seem to be working the gates opened. This happened to a couple of people. Another member of staff joined the one guy on duty but they did not seem capable of helping people. I stood for ages with my passport in the scanner and eventually tried another one which eventually worked. My husband said that maybe the scanners need to warm up but surely the staff should know this and be on hand to help and advise. What an awful welcome for overseas visitors I was embarrassed because Terminal 5 is a super terminal but the staff need to be more helpful and welcoming to visitors. I flew through Sydney New Zealand Honk Kong and Singapore Airports and Heathrow was not up to the standard of these other airports which quite frankly is a disgrace and someone should be doing something about it.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Steven Earl,Australia,7th March 2014,unverified,Flew out of terminal 3 on Monday the food offering once checked in and through security is very poor. Unless you want sandwiches (which are offered in about 10 different shops) eat before you check in. Great train service to and from London is a huge thumbs up!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,R Whitehead,United Kingdom,6th March 2014,unverified,T5 Passport Control is an absolute disgrace. The queue for EU Passport holders today was horrendous. The passport staff look disinterested demotivated and miserable. What a terrible first impression overseas visitors must receive. The rest of the airport is great but how many people are avoiding using it because of this diabolical experience. Who is in charge of this mess? Replace them and rethink the strategy. There is no excuse in this modern world for such inefficiency particularly at the UK taxpayers expense.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,G Cleaver,United Kingdom,3rd March 2014,unverified,I have to say that reading past reviews about terminal 5 relates to the inconsistent performance where one day can be a fantastic experience and the next a forgetful. On outward leg (LHR-IAD) with British Airways bag drop was very quick although the check-in lady could do with a smile. I'm impressed with the structure of this terminal with its wide open walkways and high ceilings very reminiscent of the Asian Airports. It also has the sense of freshness something that all the other 4 terminals lack. Security was a bit slow and took an age considering the number of people in the queue. One thing I must say was after security it was very very busy. Quite surprising considering the vastness of the terminal! Perhaps it was because of the holiday season. Very good range of shops and restaurants/cafes etc and good to see that duty-free isn't a rip off! Next came the walk to our gate which was in the 'B' section of the terminal which meant using the light rail system. Very long escalator trip down to the bottom where the train was located. Must've taken a good 2 minutes without walking. Train was punctual and quick. Disappointing though that if you have a gate located in the 'B' or 'C' section you are cut away from the main terminal which contains the best of shops. Only shop in the B area was a whsmiths. Nevertheless I liked the effort Heathrow have made to move away from the '10km' walk to the gate so to speak. Plane left on time and was overall a pleasant experience. Inward journey was from EWR back to terminal 5. Disappointed that we were not given an air bridge to leave our British Airways plane; somewhat strange considering that this is their hub which means they should have the best facilities for their passengers. Bus took us to the main complex which was near passport control. We were wary of the times we've had to wait in the past so 25 minutes seemed standard. Bag carousel was big and 'airy' and bags were there ready to be picked up. Heathrow connect service to terminal 4 was okay; somewhat tedious since there is no direct service so an interchange is required. Bus to car park was punctual but a bit small. Overall an impressive turn around from the horrible days of cramped airports and long marathon walks to the gate. Hats off to BAA and BA.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,C Young,Canada,28th February 2014,unverified,"Unfortunately I travel through Heathrow frequently and often use flight connections at Terminal 5. It is unbelievable that a relatively new terminal would be such a disaster when one has to transfer from one flight to another. The queues just to get through to the queue for security are unbelievable full of people panicking they will miss their connection rude staff blocking the escalators up to security in an effort to ""control"" the crowds. Once you do get to security more of the same massive queues people trying to jump ahead of others in their effort to make a connection total chaos. I cannot imagine how you survive the experience is you are elderly or infirm."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,L Vella,United States,27th February 2014,unverified,I am echoing many of the comments of my fellow reviewers by saying that I will avoid LHR in future because it has become the worst transit airport I have experienced in 50 years of international travel. The staff are poorly trained. Terminal 5 is very unfriendly to the disabled - we were separated from our 89 year old family member at several points after waiting long periods for assistance. We asked how long we would have to wait in the wheelchair holding area and even the supervisor said anything from 5 minutes to 5 hours. The British philosophy of security seems to be to zero in on easy targets no common sense is applied such as spending 20 minutes on a 90 year old wheelchair passenger. Lastly having to ride a train several times as well as go through security again and then sit around waiting for a gate number which might mean yet another train ride is just about the worst scenario you can devise for people who have to ride in cramped poorly air conditioned planes for perhaps 12 hours to get to Heathrow and then have to do the same to their next destination. Going through Madrid now seems like heaven.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Linda Hulland,United Kingdom,27th February 2014,unverified,Arrived terminal 4 on 25 Feb 2014. Had organised a wheelchair as I have breathing problems but it didn't turn up. I struggled along to stand in Passport Control for an hour or more. The queues were horrendous. I got through eventually and got to baggage reclaim to find out like hundreds of other people did that there were no trolleys. I tried to get help but there was none and they did not know when the trolleys would be collected from the car parks. I am 70 years old and had to struggle trying to pull 2 small suitcases and my hand luggage. I will never fly from Heathrow again. Quite honestly it has the worst Airport service I have ever had and I have been in many over the years.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,P Boersen,Netherlands,10th February 2014,unverified,Security check is a disaster. Led over terminal for miles waiting in queues for long times staff rude. Everybody annoyed felt very sorry for elderly people. Cannot imagine them to catch anything but bottles of water and lighters.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Octavia Grassick,United Kingdom,10th February 2014,unverified,"I had the misfortune to use Terminal 5 again at LHR two weeks ago - domestic flight. The Security Staff are horrendous they are extremely rude off-hand and downright unpleasant! I am a middle-aged professional respectable female and I find these people completely odious in their attitude. Yes of course they have a job to do but why does that involve a total lack of courtesy and aggressiveness! Unfortunately I have to use LHR on a regular basis and have now trained myself to simply ""zone-out"" and not give them the satisfaction of reacting to their behaviour!"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Jim Ash,United States,29th January 2014,unverified,Terminal 1. No comparison to other terminals - signage is strange and people are very rude. There is a physical sign that states gates 77-80 I asked where gate 76 was and rudely told - around the corner by three people. When I said there is no sign for anything lower than gate 77 I received a who cares stare. I don't utilize terminal 1 99% of the time it is terminal 3. All passengers around me had the same challenges and thought it was interesting that there were no signs for gate 76 until you actually reach it. Also when I was connecting from T3 I was told different answers to transfer and obtain a boarding pass for BA LHR-DUB.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,28th January 2014,unverified,I arrived from AMS BA429 yesterday we landed at 10.40am on time within 20 mins I was through immigration and had my baggage in my hand off of the baggage belt it is not often this happens but when it works it makes a great difference to getting home without having to wait sometimes 45 minutes for luggage so well done! I always use the Pod Parking too which makes for a fast exit from the airport too I have heard that BAA are looking to extend the Pod Parking to the long term parking further on down the road this will be great if they do as it will mean no more waiting for buses which run around 15 minutes part.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,T Smitherman,Norway,24th January 2014,unverified,"If BA offers you a tight connection Heathrow will always be an awfully stressful experience. Keep in mind you will always land late because unless you arrive before 6am you will first circle London 2-3 times. Staff are overall very rude. Every aspect of your journey is handled by a different company. I travel with a disabled family member. If you begin your journey at Heathrow disability assistance drives you to a series of checkpoints where typically you will sit unable to leave with a supervisor who hardly speaks any English. Even if you start out 3-4 hours before your flight you might have no opportunity to shop or get some food. If you have a transfer through Heathrow disability assistance insists on driving you to a checkpoint near passport control where you will be stuck for some time while the assistance staff socialises with one another and inefficiently makes its future plans. Last time we flew through Heathrow was 9-10 months ago. We had a tight connection made still tighter by the aforementioned Heathrow slow flush cycle. Disability assistance came late then sat there for 10 minutes then drove to the checkpoint and sat for 15 minutes doing nothing. Luckily a BA tight connections assistant came by and checked out tickets for the connection we were already late to board so that it would not leave without us. She also gave us orange ""short connection"" passes and asked the disability assistance to hurry up but neither was to any avail. Then we walked the remaining distance to the gate which took another 10 minutes. We were met by about ten BA employees at the gate who were horrified at how long it took for us to be escorted through the airport on a tight connection. Learn my lesson - don't transfer through Heathrow unless you really have to but certainly never do it on a tight connection."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,J Thompson,United Kingdom,23rd January 2014,unverified,Arrived by Heathrow Express not having used the airport for a good many years. No problems throughout transit to flight departure. On return I was on the Heathrow Express and London bound within an hour off stepping off the plane.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,I Saunders,United Kingdom,22nd January 2014,unverified,Flew into T5. On transfer to domestic flight we found directions confusing. On queuing for security the whole queue of approx 12 people were told off for lining up in the express line which actually was the only one open. We dutifully moved over to the correct line which she then opened for us. No word of apology or explanation. We found the staff to be rude and officious. After a 13 hour flight and after the positive experiences of 3 airports in Australia Singapore Christchurch Bangkok and Chiang Mai it was dispiriting and embarrassing. Why can't we get basic courtesy right? First impressions count.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Corbett,United Kingdom,21st January 2014,unverified,"I've never had a problem with LHR and always choose it ahead of any of the other London airports. Terminal 5 is excellent and the new Terminal 2 looks like adding a big new improvement in 2014. Access is very easy on Piccadilly Line or the Heathrow Express (which is the only London airport ""express"" train deserving of the name)."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,D Boyall,United Kingdom,14th January 2014,unverified,The airport is fine. But getting in was a nightmare for me. I wanted to park in short stay terminal three. Utterly confused by approach signs and ended up in terminal one car park. Couldn't of course get out to park in terminal 3 and had to walk a long way - not easy for one like me waiting for a hip replacement. Can't you make the signs to the various terminals clearer. There is so much traffic on the approach most of which seems to be familiar with the layout of the approach. Big clear signs indicating various short stay car parks needed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,J Campbell,United States,13th January 2014,unverified,Always find arriving and departing Heathrow airport an awful experience. Endless walking down endless corridors rude staff and everywhere an information free zone. London is supposed to be international and global show piece Heathrow let's it down every time.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,13th January 2014,unverified,Flew out 21st Dec return 5th Jan from Delhi from T4. Had a surprisingly good experience after last debacle from T3. Arrived early to find airport busy but spent an hour in hidden away pub next to airport pod hotel. Check in and security took 30 minutes and OK selection of shops airside - duty free expensive as per the norm for the UK. Flight returning 1 hour late 15 minutes in holding pattern. Immigration queue non-existent (2 minutes for e- gates) and bags arrived within 10 minutes. Pleasant experience compared to previous visits to T3 and T4 2 years previously especially given flying on some of busiest days of the year.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Peter Loni,,13th January 2014,unverified,Flew into LHR T5 on Dec 29th. Everything was fine except the security check staff. I found them rude unpleasant and offhand.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Taylor,Hong Kong,10th January 2014,unverified,Terminal 1. Flying out to Lisbon with TAP. Departure lounge okay - missing cheap coffee shop after security (EAT. is my preferred airport UK coffee) but good seats for relaxing on. My main gripe with this airport is my flight was 6am and I was coming from Kent so got a late-night lift and tried to sleep in the airport. Other than this there's nothing to remark on about this terminal I feel. There are no overnight departures (mine was one of the first in the morning).
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,8th January 2014,unverified,Flew out of Heathrow to Sao Paulo. Never understand the negative reviews of Heathrow especially from US passengers who have to endure Miami LA JFK etc. Terminal 1 was clean not over-crowded efficient with virtually no queues. And of course where Heathrow beats other airports hands down is the shopping and eating facilities. My only complaint is it would be nice to have some affordable shops. Shopping at Heathrow and other airports is more expensive than the high street not less.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,S Symon,France,8th January 2014,unverified,Disappointing experience as I was traveling through Heathrow from Paris to DC during Christmas. I agree with other reviews here that T5 is simply bursting at the seams since it's handling almost half of Heathrow's traffic. Flight connections center particularly on the outbound journey took nearly an hour to clear as there was a huge bottleneck at security. They do make an effort to help people with tight connections with express passes but they need to improve the wait times at security. Airside T5 is still very good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,S Figur,United States,6th January 2014,unverified,"I will do absolutely everything in my power to avoid flying into Heathrow in the future. They unfortunately are the passengers first taste of London and it leaves an unsavory taste for the entire country. The security is extremely rude and unprofessional. There is a lack of communication and there is a lack of respect for a person's time and flight. Do not rely on signage or website for explanation of rules. We found the rules to change from person to person. No one had a clear answer. When we finally arrived outside of the airport everyone we spoke with had the same to say about Heathrow ""avoid using them"". Regardless of price convenience (no such thing at Heathrow) try a different route. Heathrow Security was our main issue but the restaurants and staff in other areas were just as surly. I would like to think it was because of the holidays but I would have assumed kindness and respect anytime of the year. Not a good way to start our vacation."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,E Rubin,United States,6th January 2014,unverified,I have to disagree with all the praise of T5. It is already overcrowded beyond capacity for much of the day and it is often hard to find a seat. In spring summer and fall the temperature is too warm and humid for comfort given all the people inside the terminal. There are no pay lounges no lounges for Star Alliance or SkyTeam carriers (or any other carriers for that matter) and BA does not offer paid access to its lounges so if you do not have BA/Oneworld status you have no lounge access at all. This is not true in T1 T3 and T4. There are no pay showers either (unlike T1 T3 and T4)--so if you do not have lounge access a shower is not an option. The toilet facilities are also inadequate - it is not uncommon to be unable to get a stall without a long wait something that never happens in Frankfurt Munich Vienna or most other European airports. There all also very long lines at most transit desks with no automated boarding pass printers like those in German airports. Overall a very unpleasant experience if you cannot access a lounge. I much much prefer T1/T2/T4.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,R Howe,Japan,6th January 2014,unverified,Terminal 3. Arrived from NRT. Long wait at UK Border control (I'm a UK passport holder - two desks out of 7 open). Luggage waiting when I finally got through immigration. Long walk from arrival gate (Gate 1). Everything else ok.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,R Howe,Japan,6th January 2014,unverified,Terminal 1. A surprise and a delight. Quite airy bright and efficient for our flight to FRA. Everything smooth and quick.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Vincent Borlaug,United States,2nd January 2014,unverified,I must concur in Richard Hughes' sentiments (posted in this forum 11th December) - Heathrow Terminal 5 is quite good to use. Most recently I arrived from IAD on 27th November and returned 17th December on arrival passport control queues were very short (admittedly arriving on BA216 one of T5's earliest arrivals helps - will be interesting to check out next year when they deploy the A380 on this flight) and on departure (scheduled for 17.00) I only had to wait behind two people for bag drop and the security queue took about 5min. Once airside there were plenty of seats notably at the Crown Rivers pub which has expanded its seating and provides a perfect place to nurse a pint or two whilst waiting for one's departure gate to be posted and the Scotch whisky selection at the various duty free shops is as good as it's ever been. (The rule on no bag drop more than 3 hours prior to scheduled departure helps ease potential airside crowding as well.) I haven't been to any of the celebrated airports of the Far East as yet but of the airports I've been to Heathrow Terminal 5 is about as good as it gets.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,O Damnitz,Germany,20th December 2013,unverified,"Unfortunate enough to have a connecting flight via Heathrow Terminal 5 and are traveling with duty-free alcohol that you purchased legally with your boarding pass? Especially coming from Seoul or another metropolis which isn't on the ""list"" of allowed duty-free items which is not clearly posted anywhere and do not 1) have enough time between connecting flights for it to be checked should security even offer you that option or 2) not miraculously have an extra bag you can use to check it in with since your in transit or both of the above well be prepared to have Heathrow security take it away from you for no good reason. Never again!"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Richard Hodges,United Kingdom,11th December 2013,unverified,LHR T5 - DXB - LHR T5. Not quite sure what previous reporters find to complain about Heathrow particularly Terminal 5 which is always in my experience pretty good to use. Try flying into or out of any North American International Airport (particularly Newark Chicago O'Hare or Las Vegas) and you'll see just how good British Airports are. Alright not quite Changi in Singapore but pretty good. Going out 27 November no queues at BA Bag Drop and although a queue at Security it kept on moving. Let's be honest - queues at Security and Passport Control are standard just about everywhere nowadays. Once through and out of the retail mall that most airports now are we found plenty of seats tucked away in quiet corners. Coming back in on 8 December bit of a queue at Passport control and for once a 30 minute wait for baggage. Apart from that a breeze.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,J Andriani,Germany,3rd December 2013,unverified,I was flying from Tokyo to Berlin via Heathrow end of last year. The security check took so long allowing sea of people waiting on the line while only a few of grumpy staffs were working there were other staffs joking around without helping the others. They checked almost every little thing even screened my macbook air's adapter and didn't bother to let the elderly sit down first after a long haul flight. It's too bad that some respectable airlines to Japan fly via LHR otherwise I would avoid this airport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,G De Smedt,Belgium,2nd December 2013,unverified,We had a very bad experience with the security checks and the staff performing it. Flying from Brussels on October 29th we had 1.5 hours to catch a connecting flight to Singapore. Because this means you have to go to from terminal 1 to 3 by bus (this service was good) there is not much time to loose. We could go in a fast lane for the security check of our hand luggage. Our bags were put aside for further checks. One lady was performing the checks. There were 3 people before us whose luggage was put aside. The result was one staff member performing her duty incredibly slowly. I stayed at the security checkpoint waiting for our bags to be checked in the meanwhile my partner went to the airline desk to explain what was happening. After 20 minutes waiting (in that time the luggage of 3 persons was checked) finally our bags were checked. Of course nothing was wrong with our bags. We had to run to catch our flight we were the last passengers to board. This was an extremely stressful experience and all due to the misuse of power by the security staff. Very unprofessional! In the future we will avoid London Heathrow when booking flights! Reading some of the other reviews with bad experiences like ours it seems that the airport management does not care to improve things. For the record: we are experienced travellers and we had never encountered misbehaviour of security staff before.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Jack Nesbit,Canada,27th November 2013,unverified,Terminal 5 security and hand luggage screening. Staff and organisation is deplorable both in their work ethic and attitude to travellers. Would avoid Heathrow if at all possible and use other routes.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Guy Senior,United Kingdom,25th November 2013,unverified,T5. As usual swift check in ruined by badly organised and slow security. Many staff are not actually doing anything because it is so badly laid out. It needs a rethink. Coming back bags through in 15 minutes but the tube station was an information free zone. The terminal could be great if this snags were sorted out.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,M Davies,United Kingdom,25th November 2013,unverified,Returning from holiday to Terminal 4 after an 8 hour flight was not made any easier by the interminable wait for our baggage. It must have taken an hour before it started coming through - and that was after we'd walked all the way there. Is this a ruse to make money in the car parks from the people waiting to pick people up?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Tony Banwait,United States,19th November 2013,unverified,Terminal 1 - both arrival and departure on United Airlines from/to SFO. There's a lot of construction going on here at this airport. It can be seen everywhere so cosmetically not an eye appealing airport. Only complaints really was the mile plus walk to and from the aircraft extremely long lines through immigration a rather rude and obnoxious immigration officer who commented 'oh another one!' when I said I was there to attend a wedding and unusual and extensive questioning of my 19 year old son. Duty free and departure areas nice and open plenty of food and shops everywhere. Be prepared for long walks. One commonality with this airport every-time landing delays and take off queues. One of the worst.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Jeff Michel,Switzerland,18th November 2013,unverified,Yet again Heathrow fails on the basics that it is supposed to provide. With the flight arriving on time again a delay due to the inability of staff to get stairs to the plane. Add this to the queues at immigration not helped by the automatic e-passport scanners not working this then sums up Heathrow at the moment. For an airport trying to get fees to go up again way above inflation they should maybe try and get the basic services right before trying to grab yet more money from customers.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,M Riley,United States,15th November 2013,unverified,Had to go through London Heathrow twice on my way to and from Romania. The first time was an absolute nightmare. I ended up missing my flight even though I had a 2 hour connection time. It was mostly my fault because I made the mistake of not knowing that my luggage was transferred to the next flight so I went through baggage claim instead of heading straight to my terminal. I had no idea how huge and confusing this airport would be. The distances are long and require lots and lots of walking. Staff are very unhelpful if you ask for directions or assistance. The way back was much easier because I knew not to pick up my luggage and I was with a group of people. The signs seemed much more clear and easy to follow but on the way there I noticed there are some areas that have very few signs so it's easy to get lost and confused. Facilities are clean and up to date and restaurants are nice but the overall efficiency and customer service are low.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,S Satari,Malaysia,10th November 2013,unverified,Flying in and out of LHR using T1 T4 and T5. Although the immigration queue (arrival) and security queue (departure) are long the officers are doing their job. No time wasting no chit-chat and acceptable. Ambience of all the terminals are nice clean and user-friendly. Staff are firm when they need to be yet courteous and helpful. Used LHR several times and the improvement over the years are apparent.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,M Graham,United Kingdom,10th November 2013,unverified,I was dreading going through Heathrow at 9.00 in the morning but Immigration and baggage claim were all very quick. It was a welcome surprise.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,David Iles,United Kingdom,5th November 2013,unverified,Not the first occasion I have arrived at T5 to see the queues for EU passport holders stretching back whilst that for servicing non EU passport holders is almost non existent have in past seen non EU passport staff sitting idle chatting whilst queues for EU passport holders is very long. The managers within this area need to balance those queues effectively it is not rocket science and please sort the technology for the biometric passport readers. I have worn glasses for the past 51 years every time I use those machines I get different advice leave them on take them off in taking them off what is it to be. Bags arrived in about 20 mins which given the scale of he operation is I believe acceptable. So in short the border teams need to manage their workflow much better an easy task to address not sure they have the appetite: the baggage handlers are doing good job.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,J Body,United Kingdom,5th November 2013,unverified,My husband I and recently flew from Terminal 3 to go on holiday. We travelled to the airport by train and within 20 minutes of arriving at the train station we had checked 2 bags and gone through security. We were very impressed with the new security procedures. All staff we dealt with were efficient but courteous. The shopping area was pleasant and we didn't have trouble finding somewhere to sit. We would prefer to see a cheap fast food restaurant but overall found the whole experience easy and pleasant.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Paul Jarram,United Kingdom,29th October 2013,unverified,The first excuse they have the management close the airport to flights. Monday 28th October I watched flights arrive and take off at the time wind speed reached its peak at 69mph around 8.00am. All flights before then i.e. would have arrived/departed at lower wind speeds were cancelled. I had to stay an extra night in the Heathrow Sheraton paid for a car in Nice I could not drive and paid for a room in Monte Carlo in which I could not sleep. The management in Heathrow should think of their customers before they give their staff a lie in bed on a Monday morning. Pathetic. I urge everybody to avoid this airport if they can. Previous similar experience was 6 inch snow in Paris but CDG open - less than half inch snow in Heathrow but closed. As I said any excuse for a rest for the workers. Pathetic.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Elizabeth Turnbull,United Kingdom,29th October 2013,unverified,"We travelled almost thirty hours from Darwin to Singapore then Singapore to Heathrow. We had an excellent experience in Changi Airport and the whole customer service was amazing. We arrived one hour late at Heathrow and had to transfer from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. The bus driver scowled and did not even acknowledge a ""Good Morning"" after getting through customs who were polite we had a little over one hour to find our Gate for transfer to Newcastle. On getting to security we went through No 11 and the young woman had a Chant on what we needed to do I asked her to say please and was ignored we waited for our hand luggage to go through the scanners and when our small case did not come through we were told that this needed to go into a grey tray so we went back through the metal detector and the same young woman said to my husband ""You here"" and proceeded to berate us for not putting our case in the grey tray. I could not believe we were being spoken to in this manner bearing in mind that we had travelled for thirty hours were very tired and had one hour to find our gate. I would avoid Heathrow if possible when travelling as I felt that travellers were treated with contempt and scorn by people who should not have any authority."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,M Neave,United Kingdom,22nd October 2013,unverified,Flew out and back to LHR terminal one generally I found the terminal facilities good with plenty of shops bars and restaurants my one major problem was on the return and the long walk from the plane to baggage reclaim must have been a good 30 mins walk down endless corridors and have found this after returning on long haul flights the airport authority need to improve this or provide more moving walkways.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Kim Spiteri,Malta,22nd October 2013,unverified,My partner and myself flew with BA 831 on 21 Oct and had a connection flight to Malta with KM 101 departing at 10:50. Upon arriving at security at Heathrow terminal 4 at 10.00 before catching our connection flight the female supervisor at the time immediately told us and two other persons (who still needed to get our boarding passes printed at the airline desk behind security) that the flight was closed (a good 50 mins before departure time and notwithstanding the fact that there were numerous passengers still queuing at security for this same flight). She told us that we needed to go back to Terminal 1 and file a complaint with BA (who despite not having the real blame treated us very well). Unfortunately after all this terribly inconvenient incident without any logical sense or any sensibility from this Heathrow employee we ended up having to detour to Paris then Malta where we finally arrived at 20.00 instead of the planned 15.00. To top it all up our luggage (including the other detoured passengers) were did not arrive with us in Malta and were left at Heathrow. Unfortunately the insensibility of such an employee will cost the airport at least 4 families not choosing Heathrow Airport for their next travelling bookings.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,A S Row,United Kingdom,20th October 2013,unverified,Terminal 3 is a disgrace. Long delays for security with staff offering no support or assistance. It is an embarrassment for the international airport to be allowed to operate in this way. Never again. Take my advice and use Gatwick or British Airways' Terminal 5. The British Airports Authority are a disgrace to allow this to happen. The start of our holiday has been a shambles with no apology.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,P Alderson,United Kingdom,15th October 2013,unverified,Connected T5 to T1. Waited 10 minutes for a bus followed by a 10 minute journey to T1. This terminal is a maze of escalators ramps narrow corridors and long walks. The security queue was quite short but still waited 15 minutes to get through. 2 of the 5 lanes were closed. As on previous occasions at T1 I found the security staff to be officious slow and apparently unconcerned about people missing their flights. There was no fast track lane or help for those with tight connections. Several bags appeared to have been kept for hand inspection despite the fact all of us were transit passengers who had been through a security check once already. After security there was a long walk through a shopping mall to reach the gate which had very limited seating.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,15th October 2013,unverified,Flew LHR to Johannesburg. Terminal was clean functional and orderly and queues were reasonably short. Facilities excellent in terminal 1 as wit the other terminals. I can't understand the people who moan on here especially the US citizens who have to endure US airports such as JFK and LAX. Heathrow is a breeze by comparison.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Paul Foxall,Singapore,13th October 2013,unverified,I flew in this morning from Canada. I had an arrivals lounge invitation for a shower and breakfast. Unfortunately I couldn't find the lounge so I went to the information desk. At the desk instead of being helped the person behind the desk was rude! I couldn't believe it! Eventually I did find the lounge.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,C Adam,New Zealand,13th October 2013,unverified,Shops and restaurants are good usual lack of seating space. Friendly (in airport-relative terms) staff. No excessive waiting anywhere. (Terminal 3.) Plenty of toilets and clean. Showers for eight pounds.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Helen Wright,Australia,7th October 2013,unverified,Flew in to Sydney this morning from LHR T3 (via Dubai on QF2) - if you expect to get a VAT refund for cash: forget it unless you are prepared to wait for hours. I was there 2.5 hours before my flight: more than enough anywhere else in the civilised world: the queue was at least 100 people and not moving. There were 2 gentlemen at a small table to the right of the VAT queues who were apparently dealing with VAT refunds for credit cards and only about six people waiting. Anyway they took my receipts and stamped them and said they'd post them for me. The level of disorganisation was dispiriting to say the least and then the queue for security: 45 minutes or more. Thank goodness I had checked in online earlier in the day and the baggage drop (Qantas business class) was quick and pleasant.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Patrick Kavanagh,Ireland,7th October 2013,unverified,Sep 24th - Flight from Dublin was to land at 1.05pm at T1 - but it was late and landed at 3.20pm - I was connecting to BA's Inaugural A380 flight to LAX leaving from a C Gate at T5 at 4.15pm. After leaving the plane in T1 I got a bus to T1 then another bus to T5 then through Security then the transit train to C Gate - that took 1 hour 25 minutes and I barely make the flight to LAX. Lack of signage is a major problem - also the number of personnel at Security - not enough to deal with the volume of passengers. The flight itself was wonderful - but signage and more well uniformed and informed people on the ground were very lacking.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Martial Faure,Belgium,7th October 2013,unverified,Terminal 5. Never use this terminal if you have less than 3 hours between 2 flights even arriving and departing from this same terminal. Being forced to have a security check between 2 connecting flights is unacceptable.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,G Wilson,Australia,7th October 2013,unverified,"6.10am on Sunday 1 September. Handed a 'priority lane' card by the attendants on our flight. Waiting in the two allotted lanes business class passengers soon realised they were being processed much more slowly than the economy lanes. One reason was there were only two staff: the other was a female Border Agency officer seemed determined to hold everyone up as long as possible. After a third-degree interrogation - at the age of 67 (as shown in my Australian passport) - I think I had 90% convinced her that no I did not intend to work in the UK. To make sure I said: ""Look if you really want I will show you my UK passport but I wanted to enter and leave as an Aussie"". Grudgingly she stamped my Australian passport. Welcome to Britain. No matter how much money the English Tourist Board spends on promotion it's the initial impression that counts. The UK Border Agency needs to lift its game. The overall impression is: ""I am a junior public servant but I have the power to make your life miserable and I will if I can."" Pathetic."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,R Finlayson,Gibraltar,30th September 2013,unverified,Had to spend night in T3 for an early flight that's ok but did expect to maybe find somewhere open for a meal but everything was shut by 10.30pm so managed to grab a sandwich from one shop before they closed. About 35 people spending the night but nowhere you can put your head down for a few hours kip as the seats are conveniently designed with armrests making it almost impossible to stretch out unless you are a contortionist! Several passengers resorted to the floor I'm in my fifties and was pretty uncomfortable and there were folks older than me ok could have got a hotel but working on a tight budget. That said the queuing time was ok having self checked in just had to go to the bag drop but please can we have at least a coffee shop open and some seats without armrests?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,B Needham,United States,25th September 2013,unverified,"I am not sure if the difficulty is that travel agent did not allow enough time for transfer but we were very rushed with 1 hour 50 minutes. I know in some airports in the USA if booking myself I would have added more time. Going from US to Scotland we had to transit to terminal 5 and go through security once again. We were given an orange ""FAST TRACK"" sign which then seemed to have no effect afterwards but certainly is an indication that the time we were allowed was not enough. There is a lack of people giving direction and I am not sure still why we had to have our picture taken. We did make our flight partially thanks to a group of 20 travelling together who were later making the plane than we were. On the way back our plane from Edinburgh couldn't take off on time because of fog at Heathrow so we were changed to another international flight which gave us plenty of time at Heathrow. We didn't have to leave T5 but our departure gate was not posted until quite late. Someone could at least have told us that we were flying the (inaugural flight) of the airbus to LA and that it can only take off from C gates we could have moved there earlier. When they posted the boarding the board said ""now loading passengers"" but didn't say what rows they were boarding and we couldn't hear the announcements and got sent back a couple of times because we thought they had announced our row and they hadn't. A couple of ground people at the head of the line would have helped or posting the row on the board. There is a lack of helpful people in the airport. At DFW (Dallas/Fort Worth) they have volunteers to help. Allowing only 45 minutes of free wireless time is ridiculous. Even Edinburgh allows an hour of free time. Also the wireless connection was difficult to get depending on our location in the airport."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,A Saunders,United Kingdom,24th September 2013,unverified,"If you are a disabled traveller requiring pre-booked wheelchair transfers be prepared for lack of service lack of care and downright rudeness - I nearly flew back to Scotland again after waiting 1 hr on my inbound plane for a wheelchair - the aircrew - even the captain appealed for help on the radio but were brushed off. When assistance staff arrived he refused to speak to me talking only to the aircrew and referring to me as ""she"" - he put me on the bus to T3 with my luggage and had a furious row with the bus driver who told me I should have been accompanied - the driver and another passenger kindly helped me to the assistance desk at the other end (not his job at all). At T3 no wheelchair available and now my flight to Bangkok was closing in 10 mins - the staff member I found did not care at all and was more interested in surfing the web on his phone. I had to lose my rag with him to get some action and finally made it after 2hrs 10 mins - the only reason I got there was my flight was delayed by 20 mins. In contrast Bangkok was efficient and courteous as were Sydney Cairns Brisbane Perth Jo'burg and Capetown and Glasgow - come on Heathrow call that service! It was an appalling experience that spoilt the start of my holiday of a lifetime. Gatwick for me in future - I recommend if you can fly through Gatwick do I've never had any such problems there!"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,S Howell,United Kingdom,17th September 2013,unverified,We have used Heathrow for the last 2 years touching 3 and can say that it is such a stress free experience. First time we flew from here was with British Airways in 2011 to San Francisco. Second time was last October when we flew Virgin Atlantic to JFK New York. We arrived at ten am for our 2pm flight and even though we were an hour early for check in Virgin took our bags and issued boarding passes. We made it though security in ten minutes and then left on time. Our third time we flew we again flew Virgin Atlantic to JFK New York. This time everything went to plan and we took off 15 minutes early at 9.15am instead of 9.30 arriving in JFK twenty minutes early. The only down side to Heathrow is the lack of staff at border control on re-entry which took us twenty minutes to clear!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,T McLaughlin,United Kingdom,16th September 2013,unverified,T5. Big fan of this terminal. However bit of a slip up on my last arrival. Bags were to arrive on Belt 7 which as a Club Europe passenger mine did before the others. All the others arrived on Belt 6 with no notification. I would have expected this in the early days of T5 but not now.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,M Hinchliffe,United Kingdom,15th September 2013,unverified,Nearly missed my connection due to the queues at security even though the flight I arrived on landed early. The distance you have to travel to get to your next boarding gate is too long and the layout is confusing. The staff don't go out of their way to help and appear a bit jaded which is understandable considering they are having to constantly deal with so many disgruntled people. I realise we need strict security checks but the volume of passengers passing through this airport clearly can not be processed in a structured and timely manner. A few passengers had their luggage removed from the aircraft as they didn't make it even though the boarding time was extended which caused the flight to be delayed. I will purposely avoid this airport in future if an alternative is available even if it means extra cost.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,D Drake,United States,10th September 2013,unverified,Security treats you like a criminal - received a full body pat down and they require liquids separated bags scanned etc. even if you've just gone through the same process only hours earlier in order to get onto the British Airways flight that brought you there. Crowds are enormous and the process is slow. Distances are ridiculously vast - even within the same terminal I had to walk (make that 'run' to make my connection) for what felt like miles and then take a shuttle to get to the gate. The entire process is a nightmarish exercise in endurance and as a result I have vowed to myself to never put myself into this airport or through this ordeal again. The last bit is kind of a shame as the flight itself - even in coach was actually reasonably pleasant. But all in all simply not worth the misery.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Casper Yap,United States,2nd September 2013,unverified,T3. Fast tracked both ways so no queuing times for Upper Class. Own lines for immigration on arrival and security lines for departure. Only one small incident on departure my 5 year old child triggered the manometer because he was wearing regular kid shoes. First time that happened to him and he travels 2x yearly. Adult sneakers were okay. He got a pat down while the adults were through without any issue. Place crowded long lines at VAT refund. I spent my time in the lounge.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,John Gibson,Australia,2nd September 2013,unverified,"I had a great time at this airport mainly because I had an upper class virgin ticket. Got shorter queues and hanging out in the ""clubhouse"" was the best. It was almost worth the cost of the ticket!"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Casper Yap,United States,2nd September 2013,unverified,T5. Tale of two stories. On departure the security line took too long for family of three. We were directed to a line where there were no one there. Waited like 10-15 minutes before someone came over to assist with luggage x-rays etc. T5 layout is like the new airports requiring a shuttle train to take you to the other terminals (B/C). That means going down long escalators as transport is underground. Kids playground closed too early at 6pm for the night flights. On arrival everything was a breeze. No wait at immigration or baggage landed at 5 am. Restaurants and restrooms okay. Gift shops reasonable.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,J Harvey-Hills,United Kingdom,26th August 2013,unverified,I have used Terminal 5 a number of times over the last year. On each occasion queues at bag drop and security have been short. Airside the terminal is impressive. There is a comprehensive selection of shops and restaurants. The terminal is well signed and it is easy to take the short shuttle train to Satellites B and C if your flight departs from there (which most long haul flights do). The BA lounge is also spacious and comfortable. On arrival I have not experienced any queues at immigration and baggage generally arrives quickly. Flying as it should be.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Kevin Liu,Hong Kong,18th August 2013,unverified,"Departure on 15 August 2013 with CX250. A true nightmare with horror starting from VAT refund service queuing time 60 min+ and getting wheelchair service was like being in a third world country begging for help and customs and/or security check staffs (all 5 of them I dealt with) are with passenger-I-don't-care attitude. Almost everyone reminded us of the 3-hours-rule for the airport. Trust me you need 5 hours for London Heathrow terminal 3 sort of ""better safe than sorry"" thing. But if you do you will lose one whole day of your holiday just because you are leaving through ""London Heathrow terminal 3""."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,A Asprakis,United States,15th August 2013,unverified,Transferred through Terminal 5 two times this summer (have also transferred through it for the past few years) and I am really tired of the shopping mall set up - the toilets are hidden behind narrow corridors between shops that I cannot afford the stench of perfume from the shops is so overpowering that it burns one's nose and you have to pay for wi-fi. Also during my transfer in July the a/c was not working properly and the airport was way too hot. I sincerely hope that this terminal concept does not become a model that is emulated by others.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,L Williams,Australia,13th August 2013,unverified,I travel a lot and have been through many airports and this by far was the worst most inefficient airport I have stepped foot in. Terminal 3 had a 30 min wait just to get into the security gates. Then another 20 mins to get through to the scanner. Many bags were being lined up for a hand inspection with only one person checking them. Most bags had nothing in them to be removed. I was in a crowd of people waiting for my bag for 25 mins! While one lady slowly checked one thing at a time. Laughing and talking to her colleagues. There was no urgency despite the fact that I said my flight was boarding in 10 mins. I was bomb checked twice because they had nothing better to do. My bag was in a line of about 12-15 bags just sitting there while I waited. 7 people had to have suitcases offloaded from our flight too which delayed us. I'm sure this was because they were still stuck at that ridiculous security in the airport. I understand they security is for our safety but they were slow unhelpful and I have never been more frustrated in an airport. Will avoid flying there in the future.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Deirdre McCann,United Kingdom,7th August 2013,unverified,Terminal 5. This morning my bag was taken for an extra search and I was kept waiting for over 20 mins. My complaint is two fold: Firstly I was picked up for a minute bottle of perfume in my bag that has been there for multiple flights. Airport security should be consistent in its findings. Secondly was the total lack of urgency of the staff. Hard to believe they were looking after travellers with deadlines as they strolled around without a care in the world with that pompous air of power they held over you. It was the worst experience of poor customer service I have ever experienced. As I mentioned it took over 20 mins to look into 3 people's trays that just shows you how lazy the staff were.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Iain Brown,United Kingdom,29th July 2013,unverified,Do avoid this airport at all costs expect delays and queues from the moment you get near the airport. First we had to wait for a landing slot so queued in the air circling for 20 mins. Then when we did land it took 40 mins of queues to pass through passport control. Then a queue of 30 mins to collect baggage and no trolleys. Then when we made it through the airports the m25 motorway was jammed. Not a good airport. Too busy too cramped too many delays and queues. It's dated compared to modern airports - avoid.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,M Lixenberg,Israel,17th July 2013,unverified,Used T1 this summer. Long queues at passport control and extremely long distances to walk even with the conveyors but all that was nominal compared with the horrendous experience leaving from T1. The idiocy with the liquid strictness is terrible. At least put up signs so we could put things in our suitcases before they were checked in and not have valuable drinks creams etc even water thrown away. Seems they want the stores there to make money. But worst of all was the security scanning. They were abrupt and rude. inefficient and chatted with each other instead of giving service. My bag was re hauled and pulled apart after having waited 20 min all because of an empty bottle. It astounds me that a scanner cannot see if there is liquid or maybe they are down right incompetent.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Kevin Barrance,United Kingdom,10th July 2013,unverified,No problem either going out or coming back into T5. Security was a breeze and staff friendly and co-operative. Returning into T5 there were no queues at immigration and luggage came out within 10 minutes. I may have been lucky though but no complaints at all.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Paul Weary,United Kingdom,4th July 2013,unverified,Departure from T4 went smoothly with no delays at security screening. Shops and food outlets tend towards the high end and expensive but I did get a very good deal on a camera for my holiday. Had a coffee and a snack in Pret a Manger - plenty of seating available and prices seemed comparable with the high street. However there could be a better range of food outlets.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,T Patrick,Hong Kong,2nd July 2013,unverified,Arrival at T5 is quick and painless. Bit of walk a to immigration through in seconds today (5am arrival) bags out in about 20. Good coffee places etc outside. They do charge for people dropping off and picking up in cars though!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,P Alderson,United Kingdom,2nd July 2013,unverified,"Check-in at T5 was easy. Security was another matter. Almost all of the lanes in the south security area were closed. An airport employee refused to let me use the Fast Track although I was eligible as it was ""very busy"". I was sent to the north security area where there is no Fast Track. It was absolutely packed. I asked one of the staff why it was so busy and just got a shrug of the shoulders. The person on the security scanner was taking an age to check the bags as he was asking a colleague about almost every bag. The system seems to have a weak spot as two bag check lines feed into one body scanner so if a person sets off the alarm which happened frequently everyone of the same gender has to wait until that person is frisked. The rest of the airside area was extremely busy with a lot of floor space taken up with designer label shops. Fortunately I had access to an airline lounge although even that was short of seats. I shudder to think what this place would be like if a lot of flights are delayed."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Paul Tyrrell,Ireland,1st July 2013,unverified,Shameful is the only word to describe the experience of security at terminal 3 on 1st July. The staff who were in control at the fast track that morning had a serious attitude problem and would make a guess some were working to rule. If not so whoever trains manages supervises and is responsible for them is operating a total basket case. The worst experience in a long time and a promise to myself I will never ever transit through this airport again. The whole episode was in contrast to an arrival today in Hong Kong were young men and women doing the same job not only gave a professional service but looked the part as well. Shame on whoever is responsible for such a shambolic mess.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,T Cottrell,United States,21st June 2013,unverified,I had to travel through London Heathrow on May 24th when they had the fire on another BA flight and the whole experience was not only chaotic but extremely frustrating. I will never travel through this airport ever again. Not only did we not get any instructions from staff when we landed as to what we were to do next with lines in the thousands but the airport is not disability friendly at all. I ended up having to stand at that airport in line to rebook my flight for over 8+ hours. When getting off of the plane we had to get off on stairs because the ramps were not available then when you actually get inside the airport (Terminal 5) there are escalators and you could hardly find an elevator anywhere. It wasn't just the fact that we missed our connecting flight that made the experience so bad but the fact that there was such little communication about what we were expected to do next after that and the fact that there was not anywhere to sit down nor enough elevators or moving ramps etc. As far as I'm concerned they need to revamp this Terminal even further to make it more disability friendly and train their staff better to handle delays and emergencies and provide more assistance to travelers who may need a little extra help.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,David Houlihan,United Arab Emirates,9th June 2013,unverified,"Used this airport to transfer a number of times this year so far. In short as a transfer passenger I will be avoiding it at all costs. Deplaning Immigration buses more security and more pre departure checks make this one irritating stressful experience. AMS/CDG are a dream in comparison to transferring through. Security staff are apathetic slow and rude. I asked the time from one of them and the answer I got was ""time you bought a watch mate""."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Mark Ackery,United States,9th June 2013,unverified,After getting off the aircraft up 3 escalators down 3 escalators train to next terminal up 3 more escalators and then past immigration with only 2 officers working. Terminal 5 is a real mess of a terminal. Not very disabled friendly. So many people rushing off and on the transit train makes it hard to get on. Also I found terminal very hot.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,K Durmala,United States,7th June 2013,unverified,The worst airport I have experienced for transfers. While traveling to Budapest I had to transfer through Heathrow while traveling British Airways. I had to take 3 different buses and go back through security even though it was just a transfer. I had to get in a bus from the plane to a station to wait for another bus to a different terminal. Then go through security again even though we never left the airport. Then take another bus to the plane! Returning through Heathrow was just as bad. This time it was two different buses a train and security check with an added carry-on search. My bag sat waiting to be searched while employees ignored it and were just standing around. When I enquired after ten minutes I was told it was next but I guess I upset someone as it sat for another 5 minutes. I understand security procedures but the person was miserable condescending and rude.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,F Murphy,Ireland,6th June 2013,unverified,Suffice to say I shall be avoiding LHR in the future. My outward and inward flights both connected in T1. So I mistakenly believed it would just be a case of following the signs for connecting flights perhaps a security screen and that would be it. I was wrong! On the flight out we had to get on a bus and were taken on a journey of the nether regions of the airport even though I wasn't changing terminal. But as I was connecting to an international flight it wasn't too bad just the expected additional security. However connecting to my domestic flight on the way back was a nightmare. It took 1hr 10min to get from one flight to the other in the same terminal! Passport control was a farce. Only 2 desks manned and no separate queues for EU and non-EU this just holds everyone up. So 30 min later I got through the passport desk (in about 5 secs). Then there was the biometric queue completely OTT for transiting passengers. Then the confusing way to get to security. Then the security screen. As noted before very rude inefficient staff. There is no reason the whole queue should stop because someone has been pulled over for screening but this is what happens. I will be avoiding like the plague. I'll transit through Gatwick in future. I transited through CDG in March and despite its bad rep it was a dream!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Daniel MacDonald,United Kingdom,5th June 2013,unverified,I use Heathrow on a weekly basis and find it a very easy experience. The terminals are clean and tidy easy to navigate through and security never seems overly busy. The Heathrow of 10 - 20 years ago is long gone and it is now generally a pleasant and easy experience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,K Lawrence,United States,5th June 2013,unverified,I found Heathrow crowded confusing and chaotic. What should have been an easy change of planes became quite daunting. For some unknown reason the passengers seemed to be particularly rude. In some areas there seemed to be arbitrary random lines for everything without any airport officials paying attention so people were randomly jumping the lines. In other areas officials were cracking down so the lines were fairly orderly. I was very grateful when the ordeal was over and I was finally seated on my plane!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,J Taylor,United Kingdom,3rd June 2013,unverified,Needed assistance at airport waited 1.5 hrs for buggy as there was no driver then only 1 buggy. On return 1 buggy but 8 people needed assistance driver had to take some then come back for us. Just what you need after a 7 hr flight. Try not to fly out of Heathrow - back to Gatwick.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,M Moss,United States,2nd June 2013,unverified,Transferred from T5 to T3 May 30; an absolute nightmare at security. Our line ran out of bins an agent was heading toward us with a trolley of bins but then stopped to visit with a few colleagues. Then as she approached she told us they were for another line! None for us. Our agent finally slowly walked back to get some for us stopped to visit then stopped half way and went on break. Finally the agent replacing her told us to come forward and reach to get them. Then everyone had the wrong liquids bag and had to transfer into a bag provided by security. We were told to leave hiking boots on they would not set off alarm yes they did so boots back to scanner and I was x-rayed and wanded. Wondering if employees are into a work slow down as this is the worst we have ever experienced at Heathrow but it is never pleasant getting through their security. Also the agents were very rude and caustic in their comments. That said T5 is not nearly as bad but T3 i awful! Also all electronics must be removed from bags and must be our of their covers in T3. In T5 the covers can stay on. We will try to avoid Heathrow in the future!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,D Lowe,United Kingdom,30th May 2013,unverified,Check-in was quick security didn't take as long as I thought it would. The terminal building was easy enough to navigate with clear illuminated signs meaning I got to my correct gate with no problems. All in all a pleasant experience of Terminal 5 even had time for a spot of shopping too!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,J Suzanne,Hong Kong,29th May 2013,unverified,Heathrow airport departure security staff are a huge farce. Their behaviour is the most unprofessional I've experienced considering the amount of staff they have. I give their speed of performance a 1/10 and their conduct 1/10. Training needs to be overhauled especially in terms of socialising with other staff members whilst on duty. On my particular occasion after having waited 30 minutes for my bag to be manually inspected the security officer decided to leave his station walk slowly to his colleague manning the metal detector pat him on the shoulder say hello and walk casually back. Petty and unprofessional behaviour just because I asked them if they could speed things along since passengers at the airport are there to catch flights.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,J Fang,Canada,21st May 2013,unverified,Arriving in LHR from YVR at Terminal 3 departing LHR for AMS at Terminal 4. Parts of the terminal 3 building are old and deteriorating although the terminal in general is of acceptable standard and cleanliness. Customs queuing was not too bad. Baggage arrived fairly quickly on the carousel. A fairly long walk from the plane to the customs hall followed by a very long walk from the arrival halls to the tube station. Departing from terminal 4: Terminal 4 was clean and looked pleasant. However food and drinks were very expensive. No free wifi was a disappointment. Queuing time to go through security was a bit on the long side. Overall LHR surpasses the performance of many North American airports but does not come close to the efficiency innovation and customer service aspect of some of the Asian Tigers (Singapore Hong Kong Seoul etc.).
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Christopher Dunman,United Kingdom,19th May 2013,unverified,Terminal 5. The first time I'd been there and I hope the last. Had 1 hr to connect from an incoming Miami to an outbound Manchester. Miami flight late by 20 mins. Took the wrong turn and after 20 mins managed to find the right desk. Flight closed and was told rudely that it was my fault so tough. Rebooked on a flight 2 hours 30 mins later. No staff to get help from. First class manager couldn't have cared less.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,S Macgregor,United Kingdom,14th May 2013,unverified,Two visits to T5 during a recent business trip from Edinburgh via Heathrow and Madrid to Grand Canaria both of them memorable for all the wrong reasons I'm afraid. On the outward leg my flight was running late then delayed another 20 minutes until a landing slot was free and I missed my next flight to Madrid. When I attempted to rebook I was initially directed to the wrong desk by an airport employee and when I found the correct one I had to queue for 30 minutes. On the return leg my transit through Terminal 5 started smoothly enough with plane landing on time then I encountered the theatre that is airport security and no one does it better the LHR! The first act was a pleasant woman checking my boarding pass then a quick passport check at the next desk. Next I was a little taken aback when I had to have my photo taken 'for security purposes' apparently. I then proceeded to security screening I passed through without making anything bleep. After waiting 30 minutes for the gate to appear on the departure board I headed there and awaited boarding. Imagine my surprise when again G4S wanted to take my picture but had no wish to look at my passport nor any other official identification document. Another 10 minutes delay on the ground and I was finally out of that nightmare. My main gripe is with the taking of passenger pictures of a UK citizen at a UK airport on a domestic flight this is intrusion of my privacy and completely unnecessary. My passport verifies my identity and contains my photo. I travel about 30k miles year on business and have instructed our travel company not to book me any flights via LHR again unless it is absolutely and instead send me via Amsterdam or Paris even if it means more time travelling. I will also be conveying my experiences to BA and I encourage others with similar experiences to do the same.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Susan Elias,United Kingdom,14th May 2013,unverified,Flew out of Terminal 5 to South Korea on 13 May 2013 and my experience was a good one. The airport was easy to navigate and was spotlessly clean. Notice boards were well sited and displayed necessary information in plenty of time to enable you to get where you needed to be. All in all a pleasant experience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,R Clifford,Canada,13th May 2013,unverified,I made a connecting flight on May 10th 2013 - Rome to London to Toronto on BA with my checked baggage being sent through from Rome to Toronto without my having to collect and recheck it at Heathrow. Rome flight left late arrived late and I ended up accompanied by one of the connecting flights personnel running through Terminal 5 from one gate to another to make the Toronto flight. Despite not having left the secured area I had to submit my carry-on bag for re-inspection and my duty free purchase was confiscated. I feel this is unreasonable - I purchased duty free in good faith and presented my boarding pass in Rome to do so had it bagged accordingly at Heathrow I never left the secured area and was in the company of a BA connecting flights representative from the moment I set foot off the Rome plane until I started down the jet way to board the Toronto flight. Between Heathrow Security and British Airways the matter of how you deal with those on immediately connecting flights should be reviewed. Surely this doubling of scanning and arbitrary seizure of duty free goods is a waste of time personnel and goods. Connecting passengers are under your purview the entire time they are in Heathrow. There is neither time nor opportunity to purchase duty free while sprinting to the gate. (There isn't even time to go to the bathroom). The icing on the cake was the 45+ minute wait in the Toronto plane on the tarmac before we were finally cleared for take off. A bad experience all around and a lousy end to a holiday.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,13th May 2013,unverified,T3 last month. Arrivals OK Departures dreadful horrific queuing with no space for proper queue management. Awful security area especially if you get stuck behind someone with multiple 'problem items'. The Departures Area itself is basically a big shopping mall with planes parked out the back. Facilities for the passengers? well unless it involves shopping forget it. All in all a fairly dismal airport which I endeavour to avoid if at all possible.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,G Cleaver,United Kingdom,12th May 2013,unverified,Used Terminal 1 for a return flight to Moscow Domodedovo using Transaero with 3 other family members. Its noticeable how the efforts are trying to be made by Heathrow as a whole to try and improve its status (terminal 5 being a prime example) but there is still room for improvement. Interior looks very dated. Transaero seem to have their check-in zone tucked away from the main area so its a bit of a task trying to locate it. When we arrived there was an ominous-looking queue and we had noticed that the delayed take-off kept on getting extended every 5 minutes! Turned out that our plane was still in Moscow because of the weather so there was a 6-hour delay at most. We were given £25 to spend each in the airport though which explained the queue. Security was surprisingly swift very friendly staff. Giraffe restaurant very good not too expensive. Waiting seats are very hard comparable to park benches. Free Wi-Fi and good range of plug sockets. Something striking is the very long distances to walk to gates. It was a good 10 minute walk even with travelators! On return taxi to gate was very swift and we left the plane quickly. Immigration is in desperate need of a review in terms of services. Very long queues insufficient tables for filling out details (for some reason we weren't given them on the plane). Very grateful to the assistant who led us to the front because of the children (we had already waited 40 minutes). Unfriendly staff at immigration but on the other hand our baggage was all ready for collection and we were able to leave quickly from baggage reclaim.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,6th May 2013,unverified,Flew from T4 on Friday evening of bank holiday weekend. A much improved terminal where everything runs smoothly. Good staff. Nice facilities. Still too many 'upper end' shops as with the other terminals but overall very good with no queuing.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,S Mueller,Singapore,5th May 2013,unverified,Passing though T5 on my way to Glasgow coming from Singapore. Boarding pass checked 4 times pictures taken of you and staff chatting among themselves instead of trying to get the crowds moving. Airport melted down my 2hour stop over time to nothing - reaching the gate with the final call.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,John Anderson,United States,1st May 2013,unverified,Arrived from Cape Town on BA58. Good flight with BA. However on arrival wheelchair not available as requested - had been provided at Cape Town. Around 12 pax had to walk up the ramp - some in obvious distress. A buggy waiting there took pax through immigration and then 'dumped' them in baggage collection. No help to offload luggage and no wheelchair through to the outside. BA refuses to accept responsibility and the airport ignores e-mails. This at T5 - Heathrow's newest terminal and BA's so call show piece. A dreadful way to treat elderly customers and people with limited mobility. I expected more from both BA and T5. Will avoid in future.

London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,J MacMillan,United Kingdom,28th April 2013,unverified,I am all for Security but it is getting ridiculous at Heathrow Airport. Every case/bag seemed to get stopped going through the scanner - one person dealing with about 20 bags and she really took her time about things and kept going off to have a chat. At least one person missed their flight. My bag was stopped because the plastic bag I had my toiletries in was 'not a disposable plastic bag therefore illegal' - their words not mine! They then transferred what was in my see through bag which I have used every week for the last 10 months at every other airport to a 'legitimate' plastic bag. I had one toothpaste and one extremely small bottle of Bachs Herbal Rescue Remedy that would not fit so they told me I had to dispose of them! How ridiculous - I fly every week for work and all around the world will never fly from Heathrow again.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Chris Thorn,United Kingdom,25th April 2013,unverified,These comments are specifically about Terminal 5. I have been through T5 twice each way in the last month. The last time was arriving this morning on BA72 (25/04/2013) from Muscat. The previous time was to and from Edinburgh. No particular problems on departure but on arrival on both occasions the plane had to be parked away from the Terminal and passengers bussed to the terminal. The process was slow and inefficient on both occasions - it took more than 35mins before someone found steps and buses etc and got the passengers unloaded. This is old fashioned passenger handling technology now only found at second rate airports - why are passengers using the new vastly expensive T5 expected to put up with it?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,V Arnold,Australia,16th April 2013,unverified,After a long flight from Australia and landing in London I found it to be dirty no organisation staff not helpful or friendly a great welcome to the country. Toilets were disgusting considering this is a major airport. Not very well sign posted I ended up going up and down in the lift 3 times with my 3 year old daughter and a trolley as I could not make head nor tail where I was meant to go. Flying out from Heathrow I found not much choice to get something to eat or good coffee. There is hardly anywhere to sit before you can check-in and the seats are very uncomfortable. By far the worst airport I have been to!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Ewing,United Kingdom,14th April 2013,unverified,We travelled through Heathrow yet again this year having done it last year and although the experience was slightly better it still has a way to go. Yet again it was passport control where we felt let down. We were met by a young lady who tried to organise us into numerous queues allowing those in a hurry through first. However my gripe is directed at the 4 'officers' who were situated in the booth next to the one in use who were deep in discussion. If this was training It should have been done out of sight of travelling passengers or could a sign not be used to inform passengers that they are training and not just gossiping because that's what it looked like. Lots of staff around the full airport but I don't think they were all being used to their full potential and some not the most pleasant. As for the lines there it was bordering on the ridiculous as I fel we needed a map to get round them all. This may be one of the biggest airports however I would rather travel through a smaller airport and be treated by polite and friendly staff where I am treated as a human being and not a herd of cattle.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,S Mackey,United Kingdom,14th April 2013,unverified,Arrived 6.35 T5 from Sydney then bussed to T3 for connecting flight to Manchester not too much of a problem here then we and 300+ passengers queue for passport check. We had 10 mins until our next flight when others asked if they could go through quicker we were told no we had to wait our turn. We were then fast tracked through to security check which was chaos their attitude was very poor and as far as they were concerned being held up was not their problem. Unfortunately we had a duty free bottle of booze bought in from NZ with us which they took off us and told us abruptly we were not allowed to have this. We were then kept waiting 30mins before they would give my husband his hand luggage back and we missed our next flight. Would never want to use their airport again what impression do they give to overseas travellers to our country? Come on Heathrow get your act together.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,P Carney,United Kingdom,14th April 2013,unverified,Flew EI from Terminal 1. Great swift check-in EI allow you to use any check in desk and they were fully staffed. Went through security (they take your photo) which was quick. Came to the departure lounge and it was very dirty and tired. Little shopping facilities apart from a newsagents and a bar/bistro! Proceeded to the gate which on the way you are security screened again. Apart from the computer not being able to match my photographs to my passport and a group of American Diplomats getting in the way it didn't take long. The Aer Lingus departure gates are very small and twisty with plenty of walking. Not enough seating at the gate. But the upside is the EI gates are very close to one of the runways so from doors closed to take off it took less than ten minutes! Not impressed with Heathrow but with the changes EI have made it's all good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Chris Wareing,United Kingdom,4th April 2013,unverified,Arrived At T3 from Manchester then to transfer to T5 onward to Bangkok. However upon arrival there was no information on which buses to take the staff spoke broken English and were unable to understand and found the signage lacked appropriate direction. We were walking round for 30 mins then decided to just get a taxi which then cost £25 £6 of which goes to the airport we were told so we could catch our flight on time. We would consider ourselves seasoned travellers but this was the 1st and last time we will ever go to this airport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Indranil Chakrabarty,Australia,19th March 2013,unverified,Flew QF to Bangkok. It is the world's busiest Airport and you can tell. It is crowded and at places dated and dirty. Didn't impress me as that mighty world airport. The check in was quick. Arrival was a bit nasty. The customs officer poured over my passport a hundred times. The info kiosk was manned by a surly looking staff member who when I asked him a question he pointed me to a timetable and said its all in there. Duty free shops are lovely. Info display insufficient.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Bill Atkins,United States,18th March 2013,unverified,T5 on a Sunday at peak time. Good connection but I think due to light passenger load. All lines short even transfer security which can be a nightmare. Even a little humour from the staff - I think that their lack of this is often simply due to the monstrous number of not always polite people they have to deal with on some days. I wish there was more shopping for ordinary people but that is the way of most large airports now. One of my better T5 experiences.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,G Kastner,Austria,15th March 2013,unverified,T1. Lots of level changes and twisted corridors gate announced late - insufficient seating in general area to get you in the shops dirty floors. Long waiting times at luggage belt (25min) lots of traffic jams around the airport. Good range of destinations and frequencies.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,12th March 2013,unverified,T4 to HKG via DOH with Qatar Airways. Sunday afternoon departure Tuesday morning return. I've managed to avoid T4 until now and I was expecting the worst yet I was pleasantly surprised. No queues at check-in or security on departure. Pleasant choice of facilities airside with good runway views in places. Short queue at immigration upon return. The only let-down was the long wait for bags which arrived about 40 mins after landing.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,John Campbell,United Kingdom,8th March 2013,unverified,The security staff appear to be a bunch of disinterested people and they treat with such disdain. The process used is ridiculous and seems designed to delay passengers. I missed a connecting flight because I inadvertently left the dregs of a small bottle of water in my bag. Rather than do the sensible thing (as is done at other airports) and ask me if I had any liquids they decide to remove my bag after screening and have me standing around waiting for more than 30 minutes. All that was needed was to have me identify the bottle of water remove and re-screen which would have taken 2 minutes. Instead they want to empty every item from the bag. Having been through numerous major airports around the world it is obvious to me that Heathrow is about the worst you will find. The expected lack of courtesy and service reminds us that we are in Britain.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,A Robinson,United Kingdom,4th March 2013,unverified,Heathrow to Colombo (UL504). The BA desk at Manchester advised that they could not through check pax or luggage to Colombo. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the delay in baggage delivery on arrival into T5 from Manchester transfer between terminals 5 & 4 and so called ‘fast-track’ security was a nightmare - taking almost 3 hours lost in total. The lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (Sri Lankan shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used – very spacious and relaxing environment plus excellent attentive service with good quality regularly refreshed buffet food (European and Asian). For an indirect flight we will continue to use Heathrow but only provided this is limited to T5 and we can through check. Otherwise we will probably opt to transit in the Middle East (with Etihad or Emirates) to avoid the invariable delays landing into HRW and the T4 transfer/security nightmare.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Joseph Ferrerosa,United States,27th February 2013,unverified,I took the train from and to the airport. To say it doesn't is completely incorrect. I also had no problem with security they're very relaxed and got me through. You can get anywhere in less than an hour without struggling too much. It's a good airport. As for flights mine got there early and the other left on time. I took American airlines which was very good at that time. I was there in Jan. 2012.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,A Gulzar,Canada,27th February 2013,unverified,It took almost 40 minutes to clear the X-Ray area and I almost missed my AC 859 flight to Toronto on Feb 20 2013. Heathrow T3 needs a revamp just like we had it here in Toronto at Toronto Pearson Intl and it will be once again a great place to fly. Heathrow used to have free calls to landlines from the pay phones not anymore. Staff are rude but departure lounge is clean and ample seats await you prior to boarding.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,C Harper,United Kingdom,26th February 2013,unverified,One can only comment on ones own experience we have passed through terminal 5 twice in the past month arrived on a BA flight at 1215 on 25/01/13. Immigration was super fast despite automatic system being a failure made Miami look like a backwater. As for transport we had cleared immigration and collected baggage caught the rail air coach to Woking then train to Aldershot by 1445.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Ronald Arif,United States,20th February 2013,unverified,"This airport lacks the amenities that ""international"" airports worldwide have as standard features. For instance the connections between terminals should be by fast rail system rather than old dilapidated buses which get stuck in traffic or if an accident happens in the tunnels. I had a rough time connecting between T1 and T3 on my flight to Dubai. The buses which were supposed to run every 5 minutes where not showing up for good 45 minutes. The airport staff didn't understand the plight of the passengers that their outbound flights may leave without them. I had to rush myself through the security checkpoint (several security checks in fact) and then reached the Emirates Airlines counter which they told me the boarding has closed. I had to literally beg/demand them to get me onboard. I would not recommend this airport to anyone."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Sarah Colby,United Kingdom,13th February 2013,unverified,Used Heathrow several times. Never ever known a flight to leave on time. Not once. Connections to central London okay but if you are coming from anywhere else in Britain bad luck. The bus station is appalling. You can't book a bus ahead because you know you're always going to be late. Spent too many hours at that horrible bus station because inevitably the next National Express is a 2 hour wait. Usually you also spend too much time circling London before arriving in London. The terminals are old and depressing. It's like a flash back to the 70s. I've travelled a lot and this is the worst airport I've ever used. If you're going to London use Gatwick. If you're going to Europe go for Amsterdam or Rome or if desperate Paris.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,M Ramsd,United Kingdom,7th February 2013,unverified,Security at Terminal 5 is absolutely horrendous. Not due to having to be stringent not due to security measures but due to absolute incompetence. After passing through x-ray they wanted to take a second look at my laptop bag everything was removed that was supposed to be. I was stood for 25 minutes before anyone even decided to look at it this is while they are chatting away. In total it took 45 minutes to get through and I almost missed my flight. Every other airport I have been too simply pick the bag up straight away search it re-scan and then you are away. I have no problem at all with security at airports it is required and everyone is safer because of it but do not put a bunch of lazy staff to look after it.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,K Singer,United States,2nd February 2013,unverified,Transited through Heathrow Terminal 5 in Dec 2012 and then again in January 2013. This terminal is awful. The food is all terribly expensive. The shops are so expensive that no one actually purchases anything from them. The two stores that passengers were buying anything at all are Boots and WH Smith because they have the least expensive items in all of the airport. Security is completely out of hand. Security is overwhelmed due to the number of passengers that travel through this airport. It is my thought that Security has a policy of confiscating items for twofold reasons you're tired and don't want to even bother questioning and that they want you to go purchase the item from one of the stores in the airport. There are few comfortable places to sit and in most cases not enough places to sit. Interesting that they can't have a quiet zone for adults. I will never transition through this terminal again.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,C Martinez,United Kingdom,10th January 2013,unverified,Awful experiences (twice in 8 months). Yesterday the flight from Madrid an Airbus 340 was left for more than half an hour with 300 passengers inside - because nobody in Terminal 5 approached the passenger bridge. After waiting for so long in that claustrophobic situation a staircase came. On another occasion after Easter before the Olympics we were less fortunate. We were left in a parallel landing runway for 30 minutes while other planes were taking off and landing close to us. Explanation? No position was available to disembark. Never again.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Ian Edwards,United Arab Emirates,8th January 2013,unverified,Terminal 4. Now BA has vacated the facilities have reduced too. There is no non affiliated lounge. No Priority Pass access at all. Security was reasonable. Impossible for Collect at departure area traffic officers impound your car if you attempt to gain access to drop off area without a passenger on board - had to pay for car park for a 10 second transaction. Inbound E gates are not operational after 10pm so can not comment on their use. In general bad experience in what should be a first rate airport terminal.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Susan James,United States,7th January 2013,unverified,The terminal 5 once you get through the customs and search areas is excellent. The shops and food areas have plenty of choice. The seating areas are comfortable and plentiful. You have to take a short train to get to the actual departure gates - make sure you leave early enough but they are often and fast. The terminal is well marked and easy to figure out the gate locations. The place is large interesting and efficient.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Bill Atkins,United States,4th January 2013,unverified,Through T5 just before Christmas. The whole transfer experience is so much better if you are bussed from your plane as this avoids the escalator/train. Very busy but the security wait was only 10-15 minutes and this at the peak arrivals time in the early am. Of course not enough Immigration desks open for U.K. citizens but we have come to accept that as the norm. Total plane to lounge time around 45 minutes. If only one could always expect this T5 performance could be considered good but sadly not the case. Comments apply to this visit only as o many others were not this good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,M Eggleton,Australia,3rd January 2013,unverified,I like T3 it's fairly modern and easy to navigate outside and in and I like the feel of the check-in desk. I flew with Qantas and even though they had two desks open and only 3 people in the queue for the flight I still had to check myself in on the computers at Zone F which took way too long at least 10 minutes even more if your not good with computers. Getting through the boarding gate was also a nightmare was standing for at least 40minutes the staff were just too slow. T3 is good though it has decent shops/restaurants/bars and quite a lot of them. One thing that obviously needs improving though is the security check/x-ray. It was very disorganised mainly due to staff chatting and looking rather un-trained if I'm honest. It took ages to get through.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Jeremy Chan,Hong Kong,2nd January 2013,unverified,This is one of the busiest airports in the world but is one of the worst airports I have visited. Ground crew have no idea how airport service should be. Staff impolite and sometimes rude especially during the security check. They spent the time chatting amongst themselves ignoring everybody waiting next to the conveyor belt. Took 10 minutes to wait for my bag to come out. Terminals not clearly marked. Very confusing and chaotic. Awfully dirty terminal crowded and cramped. Good airport facilities with enough souvenir shops but staff were not nice at all. Lack of efficiency in this airport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,2nd January 2013,unverified,Three recent return flights from T1. I must be one of the lucky ones as I've had no major problems. All flights more or less off on time. Ground staff and security were all fine although on one occasion they took a little too much interest in my hard drive and drug-screened my whole bag and re-scanned it twice - rather over-zealous I feel. Check-in very quick on all occasions - no queues. All flights held in holding patterns but no significant delays. The usual good facilities airside. No problems on arrival other than 15-20 minute waiting times for bags. Immigration quick efficient friendly and adequate staff.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,S Keane,Ireland,28th December 2012,unverified,"Flew from the Middle East on December 20 2012 to Terminal 4 transferred to Terminal 1 to make a connecting flight. Security staff at Terminal 1 rude chatting amongst themselves while they decided to select my carry on for a random search by a woman with a poor command of English. Both I and my colleague explained that we had to make a connecting flight staff couldn't have cared less continued to take their own sweet time chatting amongst themselves told us and other people travelling with small children to ""be patient"" before attempting to open our luggage. We missed our flight staff at the British Airways desk were sympathetic and concurred that security staff in Terminal 1 were rude to them and have resulted in many passengers missing flights. Heathrow airport transfers are not for the faint hearted poor signposting I would not recommend for anyone elderly the distances are huge and it is easy to get lost. Very dated."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,M de Mol,Netherlands,14th December 2012,unverified,LHR Terminal 4 Wednesday 12 December 2012 19.05. Queue of more than 1 hour (which you don't know when you step in) probably because of fog in the morning (if there were more runways this issue would not have been so severe). No communication as to why this situation exists when asking for help there was no willingness to support passengers having to catch their flight. No system dividing between people with earlier flights and people with later flights. No apologies given. Very very slow security: one scanner for 2 baggage lines. No separate baggage line and scanner for Fast track. If the scanner beeps you have to wait for more than 2 minutes so queue gets even longer. Very poor service of LHR terminal 4 please improve. Thanks to KLM I did not miss my flight.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Jan de Hoop,United Kingdom,14th December 2012,unverified,T4 security queue made me miss my flight (1 hr 15 minutes in the queue). What is the use of flying if you have to be there two hours before just to go through security. Next time I'll definitely try to avoid Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,M Eggleton,United Kingdom,14th December 2012,unverified,I've come through Heathrow five times this year so far and it's always a breeze and never have to wait more than 10 minutes waiting to get through customs. The revamp of T3 and T4 are great. Free airport Wi-Fi was near impossible to get on as with most airports. No free kiosks either or places to plug in devices. No places to lay down only seats. There was a couple of TV's showing sports but you couldn't hear them very well due to the noise of the hundreds of people in the terminal etc. Heathrow still feels dated in places mainly baggage claim and customs. Compared to some SE Asian airports like Singapore we are a decade behind.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,C Era,United States,12th December 2012,unverified,Travelling to London from Palm Springs via Dallas (frequently) we arrived at Terminal 5 which was very impressive clean efficient our luggage took minutes to arrive and we were through immigration in 15 mins. They were polite and welcomed us. Departing T5 was a breeze lots of helpful staff spacious light and pleasant check in hall. Security fast and efficient and more shops and restaurants than I have seen at any other airport other than possibly Amsterdam but the food is much better at T5. Interesting to hear Americans moan about immigration lines I have been in line for 4 hours at LAX on 3 occasions and similar waits at MIA on many occasions. I do agree that free WiFi would make a huge difference but over all I think it is one of the best terminals in the world.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Roger Stone,Australia,12th December 2012,unverified,A tale of two Terminals - my flights into and out of Terminal 5 were fine with courteous security staff and immigration officials. However my experience at Terminal 1 was horrific and echoes many comments also written here. The worst aspect for me was having my bag (laptop bag in my case) taken aside for a random second inspection but then seeing it left there for ages in a rack while staff laughed and chatted amongst themselves seemingly oblivious to the fact that we have flights to catch. At Australian airports such 2nd random searches are carried out promptly and courteously by another officer further on in the process and that's fine. However at Heathrow Terminal 1 I had my bag left in a side rack for ages with staff wandering off somewhere else for a chat and a laugh. I for one will try to avoid using Heathrow Airport and spending money at its airport hotels and restaurants and instead spend my time and money using a northern European hub such as Frankfurt in the future.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,N Bromwich,United Kingdom,10th December 2012,unverified,It had been many years since I last visited Heathrow so I was essentially starting afresh. This was the final part of a lengthy flight from Adelaide to London via Sydney and Singapore so I was hoping for a smooth experience. Fortunately this was what I got. We had an easy departure from our plane despite having to wait till last due to having a family member on crutches. The airport staff immediately arrived with a wheelchair for assistance and then fetched a golf buggy to get us around quicker. Staff were very friendly and we got through immigration within a matter of minutes. Having had to wait behind on the plane our bags had concluded their cycle on the conveyor belt so ours had been placed to one side to collect which further sped things up. Restrooms were extremely clean and modern we managed to navigate the airport with little or no problems at all and the freezing cold outside instantly shook off any lost sleep on the flight.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,A Lane,United States,7th December 2012,unverified,I hate transiting through Heathrow specifically for two reasons: Immigration control and security. I have to clear immigration before connecting to my UK flight and there is always no more than two Border Agency officers on duty. They are either belligerent or disinterested towards non-EU passengers like myself. There are two lines-one for EU citizens and the other for non-EU citizens-where each time the officers give preference towards EU citizens while ignoring those in the non-EU line. My advice is for non-EU citizens to make sure to have at least 2 hours to transit because of this ridiculous practice. As to security it has become a nightmare recently. On my most recent experience my handbag was 'randomly' selected for a thorough search. To make matters worse the security officials take their leisurely time. I did not have my handbag checked until after a good 20 minutes of waiting around. They do not care that many passengers are in a hurry to catch their flights! Instead I noticed officials joking and talking amongst themselves oblivious to these randomly selected bags they need to check because passengers are waiting for them! This type of supposedly extreme checking is a huge farce really accomplishes nothing but hassle to the passengers. If not for the immigration & security issues Heathrow's T5 is quite nice provided one has time to actually relax and shop and eat. I lost so much time on my outbound journey due to the idiotic procedures of immigration and security that I could barely get to buy some water and use the toilet.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,B Bilton,United Kingdom,5th December 2012,unverified,I had an outbound and inbound flight to T5 so I will write them separately. Outbound: Excellent in one word no queues extremely fast first check in with courteous staff and staff that appeared interested in you and your plans. Passport control and security was empty and so we split up between fast track and normal both ending at the same time. I was searched and x-rayed routinely but it was an efficient and non-invasive process. Excellent facilities for shopping and eating but there is one drawback with T5 which is the short amount of time they leave to publish the departing gate number which was alright for our flight as it was an A gate but there were B and C gates being called close to departure which does not allow for enough time to be given to transfer to the satellite terminals comfortably. Boarding was pleasant with priority boarding and happy staff. Inbound: The C satellite terminal had problems trying to attach the tunnel to the plane which meant we lost the 20 minutes of flight time we had made up as well as extra time but the captain and crew were very reassuring. Once we were disembarked the transition to the main terminal was quick and efficient with a train for the transit system arriving at C as we made it to the platform. Immigration was fast with staff that wee polite and friendly and too interest in your travels. By the time we reached the carousel our luggage was coming round resulting in disembarking to taxi rank in just under 20 minutes.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,R Taylor,United Kingdom,30th November 2012,unverified,I absolutely loath having to travel through LHR for a number of reasons. Nasty cramped dirty and poorly laid out waiting area for the departure gates at terminal 3 which has only wildly overpriced junk food available to eat. The approach to the check in counters from the underground must rank as some of the worst anywhere in the world with water leaking from behind a wall seeping across a filthy floor making it extremely slippery and dangerous. However the absolute worst aspect is the understaffed immigration queues. I know it's a constant complaint of those of us unfortunate enough to have to use this airport but management seriously has to start to listen. Clearly understaffed the few officials who are tasked with processing arrivals are obviously over stretched and are struggling to cope with what is being asked of them. I don't blame them for being snappy and irritable as the job they have been given is close to unmanageable but its an absolutely appalling way to welcome visitors to this country to make them stand in endless queues while only 3 or 4 counters out of an available 20 or so are staffed. Penny pinching is really making LHR a place to be avoided at all costs.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,A Bent,United Kingdom,27th November 2012,unverified,There has been an enormous effort put into making the facilities and environment here fit to be confirmed with other major international airports but if an airport can't get planes away on schedule it all starts to seem a bit irrelevant. Last time I caught an international flight from Heathrow it was 3 hours late. Gave it a second chance - and this time my flight was 4 hours late getting away. Will not be using it in future.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Steve England,United Kingdom,27th November 2012,unverified,Have travelled to and from LHR a number of times over the years. There have been improvements and the airport generally is pretty user-friendly. Even Terminal 5 is good after the initial horrendous problems to the traveller from USA who thinks that Heathrow has the worst layout of any airport in the world have you never been to Miami International Airport?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Fischer,United States,26th November 2012,unverified,Like many major international airports London Heathrow has both its assets and downsides. On the positive side it's an extremely clean stylish and very modern looking airport. The eating and shopping options are without a doubt the best there are not only in Europe but possibly the world. The signalling within the airport is clear and concise so losing yourself is hard to do. However Heathrow is rife with poorly mannered employees (most of whom do not speak any other language other than English) long lines everywhere (especially as passport checks these can last for ages) overly priced shops and frequent delays. If you are transiting through the UK's biggest airport give yourself at least a 2-3 hours layover.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Jeremy Chan,Hong Kong,26th November 2012,unverified,The airport is old and the efficiency is very low. Although the airport is very big I got easily confused in the airport. I waited for 10 min for the X-Ray scan excluding the queue up time. Heathrow should be one of the best airports in Europe and shouldn't be like this.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Bill Stevens,Australia,23rd November 2012,unverified,This is the worst airport I have ever travelled through. The security staff at the X-ray are rude and insulting. I had my bag emptied onto a bench in front of everyone. When I asked if there was a problem I was told it was random. If you can avoid it.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,S Jariwala,India,16th November 2012,unverified,One of the worst airports only 1-2 officers dedicated to fast track many times the whole flight has passed immigration and the first class passenger is still way back in the queue.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,N Hulm,United Kingdom,16th November 2012,unverified,Flew into T4 LHR on 13/11/12. It was very quick indeed 20 minutes from landing to immigration (even used the self-scanning system not sure of the point as no quicker than a real person and seemed a little temperamental) baggage and customs to leaving the airport. What a breeze and well done.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,C Tung,United Kingdom,14th November 2012,unverified,Used T4 in October/November. The first negative point about T4 is that if you travel on Heathrow Express from central London you have to get off at Heathrow Central (For T1/3) then wait for another train to T4. Check in was smooth and less chaotic than T3 despite during busy hours. Security check was fast if you don't get picked up for additional check. The shopping area very dark and uninspiring not many choices either. Poor food and beverage selections and there is no Priority Pass lounge available. Arrival was good. Not too long walk to the immigration (unlike T3) and there wasn't a long queue for EU/UK passport holders. Different story for foreigners though and I did have a lot of sympathy for the poor passengers who had been on a long flight and had to wait for another hour or so to go through immigration. Bag arrived very fast which is consistent with all other terminals in Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,A Sargeant,United Kingdom,14th November 2012,unverified,Terminal 4. Departing - far more enjoyable experience than T3. Nice range of facilities clean easy check in experience security a breeze and quick boarding. Hassle free experience. Arriving - 30mins circling London at 6.30am Sunday morning. Not much space in baggage collection area but smooth easy connection to Tube. However Passport Control big queues. Lots of flights must have arrived at same time but few staff (especially on international desks) - queue was well past the 'at least 45 minute board' down corridor before even reached the hall and lack of signage was confusing as queue was way before a sign highlighting which queue to join. E-gates were playing up but got through manual control reasonably fast and out the door in 30mins from getting off plane. International passport holders would have been much longer!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,12th November 2012,unverified,Not for the first time has a flight been changed from gate 8 to gate 80 with little or no notice and it's a fair walk. Something to be aware of if your flight is posted for Gate 8.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,Tom Bauer,United States,12th November 2012,unverified,Definitely the worst airport I've ever transited. The availability of wheelchair assistance was spotty and the wheelchair assistance co-ordinators were not polite. When we really needed one there was no one at the assistance station at all. We missed our flight and were delayed 24 hours. Even without assistance challenges Heathrow has the worst layout of any airport in the world. I would have thought it would be better after the Olympics. Not so. Transferring between terminals is interminable.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Sean Collins,United Kingdom,9th November 2012,unverified,Arrived to check in at T5 for early eve flight to Philadelphia. Absolutely no queue at the Bag drop and was quickly checked in by the welcoming check in clerk. Security was quick and efficient. Boarded from C gates which were very quiet. Efficient well organised boarding.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,8th November 2012,unverified,"Terminal 5. Bag drop queues were long about fifteen minutes passed through fast track into security to be delayed over half an hour because they seemed to be taking every other bag for additional screening. Bags and passengers were stacked up waiting for the two screeners to get round to them. They unpacked each bag completely and swabbed them all and every hard surface in each passenger's belongings. They even searched my wallet! They found nothing of course in any of the eight bags/passengers in front of me in the line. What a waste of time and resources. My previous good opinion of T5 now in ruins. The ""pod"" transfer from car park to terminal however was fast and efficient."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,0,M Altman,United States,27th October 2012,unverified,Arrived T3 and had an outbound at T5. While going through T5 security they were picking out every 3rd or 4th persons bags for screening stood there for 30 minutes until they got to our bag unloaded every item one by one at a glacial pace. Then went over to do the swab talked with their buddy and finally returned. 10 people were waiting for bags to be gone through at least and then he leaves leaving all of us standing there with no replacement. We will go around London next time.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,D Robertson,United Kingdom,25th October 2012,unverified,Came through the fast track and had my bag set aside for a search. I waited 10 whilst the staff stood and had a conversation. They then put my bag back through the scanner but then decided they wanted to search it anyway. My bag was then taken to the other end of the security hall and put through another scanner whilst the staff member stood and chatted to his colleagues. He then brought my bag back and painfully slowly emptied every single compartment. He opened the pouch that had all the cables for my laptop in and zipped it back up without even looking in it. After the bag was completely emptied he asked would I like him to re-pack my bag. I packed it myself to save time. He made a mockery of the security at T1.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,B Marcus,United States,9th October 2012,unverified,I recently arrived at LHR Terminal 4 and departed Terminal 3. I had Fast Track both ways. My United flight arrived 40 minutes early at Terminal 4 and I was expecting a breeze in the Fast Track line. Unfortunately the line was long in the Fast Track line and took over an hour. I departed from Terminal 3 and there was nobody in the Fast Track line. However my bag that went through the X-Ray screener required a personnel to search it. I had to wait over 20 minutes till the security agent got to my bag. They explained that they are very short staffed. I think this is unexcusable for the busiest airport in the Europe that just had the Olympics there. Terminal 3 itself is nice and had a lot of restuarants and shops.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,D Eaton,United Kingdom,23rd September 2012,unverified,Came back via Madrid into T5 and after Immigration where they were still welcoming visitors to the Paralympics 10 days after it finished - how hard can it be to revert the screen messages? We went to baggage reclaim. Followed the signage to the relevant belt and waited. Eventually cases started to trickle out now about 45 minutes from landing time but not ours. Asked a passing worker how long it should take and were told about half an hour but maybe check for other Spanish origin flights. There weren't any but as our concern and indeed panic rose we began walking the length of the hall checking every belt where eventually we found one case on the belt for a flight from Abuja Nigeria. After nearly an hour we were about to go to baggage enquiries office when the last case appeared on its own again on the Abuja flight belt. You have to ask what kind of system manages to misplace not one but two cases so very far from correct. This terminal appears still not to have fixed its problems.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,A Gordon,United Kingdom,19th September 2012,unverified,Arrived morning (07.30) of 14 July into T5: no queue at passport control and the luggage began to come through as I arrived at baggage reclaim. Time from aeroplane to taxi rank was 20 minutes which was quite good considering half of that was spent going from the gate to passport control. Passport control person was not impolite which made for a nice and very welcome change.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,16th September 2012,unverified,Flew out of Heathrow to Warsaw from Terminal 1. Found it to be fine with little queuing and good facilities. Staff mostly friendly too.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,S Ottaway,Norway,10th September 2012,unverified,The improvements I have noticed from Heathrow are absolutely fantastic! Years ago however it was a different story and I'm glad that this can be said! Terminals are clean well decorated and for the most part have excellent shops! Overall had a very satisfying experience there and a fantastic welcome back to the UK. Staff were very friendly!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Anna Kleinzahler,United Kingdom,4th September 2012,unverified,I usually fly from T1 or T5 but this time went through T3. It has improved. Check-in staff at SAS were excellent and quick no need to queue and wait same when I got to the gate no waiting to board aircraft. Passing through security was no more then 5 minutes. Then the path meanders through Duty Free which I could do without. Waiting area a bit crowded plenty of choice of places to get food and drink and other luxury shops. Good and clear signage and the walk to the gate not too long. Could do with a few more toilets in the waiting area one seemed to be closed. Return also smooth. No difficulty at passport control in fact staff there friendly and had a little chat over why the automatic gates don't seem to recognize my passport. 20 minute wait for luggage which is not unusual for Heathrow. The terminal has improved since my last trip through it. The only frustrating downside was the free wi-fi did not work and on my return leg finding the way to the underground was not well indicated.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,S Wilson,United Kingdom,3rd September 2012,unverified,My husband and I arrived at LHR T1 recently returning from India. For the second time in our travels we had more hassle at T1 than in the Indian airports we had visited (and we've been through all the major ones). After being told to keep my shoes on when I got through the initial scanner I was curtly asked to remove my shoes so that they could be scanned. After being frisked and finally the metal detector run across me (this is the first thing they do in India by the way) and being told to put nothing back into my pockets my belongings were gathered together by one of their officious security staff members I had to go through the body scanner after which I was frisked again. Have they never heard of metal buttons on jeans? After that the three officials started chatting and I actually had to ask if I was free to go.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Beryl Jonsen,United Kingdom,3rd September 2012,unverified,Wheelchair help through the airport atrocious. No help at all in early morning. Non walking person had to walk quite a long way to find a lift then the help station was unmanned. Eventually we did get a wheelchair. Grudging service. What a difference in other European airports where service is fast and friendly. On arrival back in UK we were passed between 3 different people and then after a 20 minute wait for a chair the attendant on the help desk suggested that my non walking husband walk down to the baggage claim and collect the luggage then come back and wait for a chair! When we finally did get a wheelchair the attendant kept stopping to chat to friends other airport staff. When I asked if we could get on and go to baggage claim and immigration the friend to whom the chap pushing the wheel chair was chatting began to laugh at us. This is not good enough Heathrow. You do not measure up to the standards set by other European airports.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,A Wisdell,United Kingdom,30th August 2012,unverified,Arrived from JFK into T5 from overnight flight. Bit of a walk and internal transport from arrival gate to immigration/bag reclaim. No problem with immigration queues and bag arrival was fast - I mean fast compared with the usual wait of up to 1hr where BA have previously been concerned. On arrival in baggage hall bags already on their way through. All round a very smooth and pleasant experience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,M Maleque,Bangladesh,30th August 2012,unverified,The queuing time at Heathrow was quite reasonable and the staff were quite efficient and friendly. Check-in and immigration went quite smoothly. The airport was quite crowded though so it was a bit annoying to find a place to sit. There's no free Wi-Fi which was quite disappointing. And I think that the shops were quite expensive compared to other large airports.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,S Worsley,Australia,30th August 2012,unverified,Appalled at the rudeness encountered at immigration. Immigration officials do not have to be rude when they encounter someone such as myself entering with no known address. A simple statement that an address is required is sufficient. I believe that most people are reasonable if approached in a polite manner. There was no name badge worn by the two people I encountered making it impossible to lodge a complaint against them. Left a bad impression.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,T Andor,United States,28th August 2012,unverified,Connected in Heathrow from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Terminal 1 was nice great shops services restaurants one of the best I have seen anywhere. Didn't see the other terminals but based on Terminal 1 I would say Heathrow should be a 5 star airport. Very impressed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,S Symon,United States,28th August 2012,unverified,Terminal 5 is a breeze. Connected through the airport 3 times over the past 3 months and each time Terminal 5 was working smoothly. My only complaint is the late notice of your gate but only once did I have to take the underground train to Terminal 5C.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,P Goddard,United Kingdom,24th August 2012,unverified,T3 - arrival. The airport was very clean. Had to wait to get through immigration for about 15 seconds. All the staff acted very pleasantly friendly and were asking where we had been etc. For the 3 of us we only talked to the customs officer for about 15 seconds also before we were let through. Well sign posted (BAA signs as well as ones for London 2012). There were plenty of staff about (as well as ones for London 2012). However we had to wait for about 15-20 minutes for our baggage to come through and we were almost at the normal bus stops before we saw a sign saying that the Hotel Hoppa had be re-allocated to the Central Bus Station (we had to back track through the terminal which was difficult) which seemed miles away.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,L Dewhurst,United Kingdom,19th August 2012,unverified,Appalled at terrible lack of thought in to how passengers transfer from Terminal 4 to Terminal 5 (and vice versa). I was travelling from Terminal 4 but coming from Oxford on the bus which drops off at Terminal 5. There was no signage at all as to how to get between the two terminals. After asking airport staff we eventually found we had to take a local bus. There was no information as to whether the trip would be free (it was) and there was no space for luggage on the bus at all which if course most passengers had. Please improve this! Signs at least - but a dedicated transfer bus with proper luggage space would be better.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,P Cairnduff,United Kingdom,19th August 2012,unverified,I found myself visiting three of the four terminals this summer on a return trip. Thankfully I must have travelled at the less busy times since I rarely experienced any long queues or other unpleasant aspects of using large busy airports. Zipped through T3 security and on the way back flight connections from T5 to T1 were well signposted and quick enough.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Maxwell Press,Australia,14th August 2012,unverified,Arrived with Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong at 2.45pm on May 17th 2012 to find a huge queue at Passport Control in a zigzag formation everyone tired and only 3 control booths open so we waited over 50 minutes to be passed through to baggage and customs. What a way to be welcomed to London and the UK! And why don't countries dress up their entrance halls with advertising to boost their countries good points? Arriving in a bare concrete hall is the pits!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,14th August 2012,unverified,Flew out of and into Heathrow during the last weekend of the Olympics. Expected chaos but was all very smooth and seamless. No queues at immigration inbound although flight was one of the last ones in. Luggage on carousel when we got there.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,N Sutherland,United Kingdom,12th August 2012,unverified,T4 - two return trips in the past 3 months. Check-In's (Qatar and Etihad) not especially well organised. Security very slow and not a patch on the new facilities in LGW. Departures is basically a big shop with planes parked out the back. Facilities for the passengers? Who? What's wrong with shopping? Arrivals not too bad with most of the Immigration counters manned. The Baggage wait was an average of 45 minutes which is not good in a Baggage Hall which didn't appear to be especially busy. All in all not a great experience (but better than LHR T3 and not as good in any measure as LGW).
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Beverley Wahl,Norway,9th August 2012,unverified,Terminal 5. I had great expectations when T5 opened but they were promptly dashed. Unbelievable to find a modern airport terminal where you still have to pay for internet use and with coins. Another piece of bad planning is the placing of the information signs when you come through departure security. As you gather your scattered belongings you look around for signs - and at first glance there is nothing. They're there but not immediately obvious. You have to wander around a bit and get the right angle of approach. Needlessly unsettling when you're already stressed. Terminal 4 - last experienced but never to be forgotten just before Terminal 5 opened. We were booked from Oslo to Johannesburg with BA but when the BA flight from Oslo was delayed we missed the connecting flight. We saw the last passengers go in and the doors close but the staff we pleaded with to get us on the plane were unmoved. We were put into a hotel and booked on the next flight to Johannesburg which was a KLM flight but unfortunately only early the next morning. We were issued with tickets for a bus that hadn't started running by the time we left for the airport. Our luggage of course remained at Heathrow. Over the next 2 weeks we phoned the airport daily. Yes they assured us our luggage was at Heathrow - they could even describe it to us. But at Heathrow it remained though nobody could explain why. It finally arrived the day before we left to go home.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,G James,United Kingdom,5th August 2012,unverified,Terminal 3. Crowds outside queuing for vat refunds then inside to a terminal which was absolutely packed and when I got to the business class check-in it was so loud that I couldn't hear the check-in staff giving me directions to the lounge - I had to call my daughter over to help me. Fast track was indeed fast and then up to the departures lounge which was crammed with people and no clear signs as to where the business class lounges were. Coming back (which on a previous trip was horrendous) was simple - straight through to the iris reading gates which were brilliant and then to the baggage carousels where my luggage appeared in minutes. T3 needs a massive overhaul for outgoing passengers - it's just not good enough for such a major airport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,Tia Traynor,United Kingdom,5th August 2012,unverified,Check-in was quick and smooth. Luckily upon arrival there was no queue at the immigration. Baggage claim was quick I didn't have to wait for long to get my suitcase. I travelled to Heathrow just few days before the Olympics and was expecting it to be busy but surprised myself as everything was smooth and quick.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Henson,United Kingdom,5th August 2012,unverified,Used Terminal 1 for flight from Belfast on 5 August. I was in T1 arrivals within 15 minutes of my flight arriving. Disembarkation process was fast and efficient and staff were polite and welcoming. Terminal was quiet and clean albeit a little outdated and rough around the edges. Given the intention to demolish T1 I can understand why BAA do not want to spend a significant amount on improvements but my main aesthetic criticism would be the underground tunnels that run from T1/T3 to the London Underground station. They are dirty poorly lit and create a bad first impression of the UK.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,D Tomlinson,United Kingdom,31st July 2012,unverified,I'm afraid to say that Heathrow is well past it's sell by date. I am a regular traveller with Cathy Pacific out of Heathrow T3 but my last trip was truly unforgiving. I arrived at 6pm for the 8.45pm flight the terminal was packed like I've never seen it before the queue that was in front of the first class check-in desk was bound for Canada so I had to barge my way through that before I even got to the desk. Once checked in I had to make it to the stairs that take you up to security things was that all the queues were stopping people from getting to the stairs. It was total bedlam and there wasn't even any staff on hand to help solve it. Security was a disgrace the fast track lane was slower than the normal lanes! Inside it was even worse there is no order to it you arrive into a bottleneck that then leads into a retail duty free store. It was absolute madness and the worst I've ever seen it.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Tor Idar Larsen,Norway,25th July 2012,unverified,Terminal 3: packed low ceiling. Out-dated. Something should be done quite soon with this terminal. Terminal 5: stayed here during the snow blitz in 2010. Superb design much space lots of check-in counters friendly staff as well. The man let us check in much before we really should. Superb transit area as well. I can see issues popping up very quickly as it's such a big airport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,R Carter,United Kingdom,13th July 2012,unverified,Arrived from Toronto at 6am ahead of schedule and made a swift transfer to Terminal 1 via Flight Connections. Immigration was also a breeze using the dedicated channel for domestic and Ireland departures. Owing to a ticketing problem I then had no choice but to return to Terminal 3 to see Air Canada/British Airways. In all it took 3 hours to re-negotiate the now-longer queues and make the repeat transfer - mind-numbing after a very long overnight flight! To Heathrow's immense credit I found practically every employee I met to be good-spirited helpful and tactfully humorous; from the lady transfer bus driver to the immigration officials. Several recognised me after passing several times through the Connections centre and they could not have been more charming making a pretty unpleasant experience seem not so bad after all.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,A Annakin-Smith,United Kingdom,9th July 2012,unverified,Every time I use T5 I regret it. Is it a job requirement that they will only employ rude staff? It made me cringe to watch a BA check-in team member twice shout loudly and rudely at a woman because she accidentally overstepped a line she should have waited behind. Or the immigration woman who was quite abusive to a lady who merely asked - not complained - why a retina scan was needed. Then there is the ability of T5 to lose my luggage even with state-of-the-art baggage systems and a 1.5 hour connection time. How do they manage it?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,S Srinivasan,United States,8th July 2012,unverified,"Maybe I got lucky but the transfer experience when going between terminals seems to have improved considerably since my last time here. I was transferring from T5 (BA) to T3 (AA). Signage was generally good staff helpful and the queues short and moved quickly. They even have a special ""short connections"" line at the T3 transfer security area if you have less than an hour before your onwards flight. Perhaps being here early on a Saturday morning helped but I was pleasantly surprised after expecting the worst. I went from the gate at T5 to my seat in the lounge at T3 in just over 30 minutes; not bad at all for an airport this size. My one complaint is the lack of information on how to transfer to a non-BA airline. All you see are signs that indicate connections within T5 and for connections through ""all other terminals"". If you don't happen to know which terminal your airline flies out of this can be confusing. On the plus side staff were quite helpful in checking to make sure you were headed to the right line."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Kim Thomsen,United Kingdom,8th July 2012,unverified,"LHR Terminal 5 on Friday 6th of July. I had the displeasure of waiting 26 minutes just to drop my bag at the check in counter which did say ""Bag drop"". Waiting time in security was no better with a 10 minutes wait. Generally speaking the check in experience was very poor and clearly showed that BA is the only customer in this terminal and they are contempt with aware. When I get to one of the many restaurants did the experience improve. Here service was fast and efficient. A visit to one of the many toilet showed them to be fairly well kept and in good working order. Sign posting is a bit messy mainly because the informative signs of where to go drowns in advertising posters for various tax free products. Overall a very mixed but rather poor impression of this new terminal. It could be so much more if just BA and BAA wanted it to."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,S Morrow,United Kingdom,5th July 2012,unverified,Do not attempt LHR if you need wheelchair assistance - arrived from Seattle Sunday 11 am and were lucky to make our 3pm connection in T1 due to chaotic special assistance in T1. We were made to feel like a nuisance to be moved about rather than customers. Also security staff at T1 rude impatient arrogant and when I complained female supervisor backed them up and told me off! A disgrace I would hate to be arriving for Olympics. These staff need to seriously up their game. Have travelled on a number of occasions in USA staff are firm but polite. I am embarrassed for what visitors will think of Britain.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,R Mustafa,Australia,3rd July 2012,unverified,"My wife and I travel a fair bit and to date our worst ever experience was at Heathrow Airport. It all started off with a queue that stretched beyond the 1km mark fuelled by a 2 hour wait. We were flying in from Australia with a stop over in Dubai. After a long flight I couldn't remember the address of my friend's place where we'd be staying for a few nights (in London). Once we walked up to the immigration office I promptly apologised for the missing information and informed him that I did have it on my email but can't access it since there wasn't any free Wifi access in that terminal (we flew Emirates to London). The immigration officer rudely pointed towards a row of people who were detained and I believe would've been checked for drugs illegal travelers etc. He said and I quote ""next time you forget the address you will be sitting there till you remember where you will be staying"" and smirked. I was shocked to see this attitude from someone who was my first point of contact with London. I can't imagine the treatment people will receive when they fly in for the Olympics. I give Heathrow a big zero."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,J Henson,United Kingdom,17th June 2012,unverified,T5 arrival on evening of Sunday 17 June - arrived in the domestic area of T5A on a European flight due to the lack of availability of stands - slightly worrying that there are already such capacity constraints given that this facility is only 4 years old! We had to leave the aircraft via steps and then travel by bus to international arrivals. The terminal was clean and bright as usual but there were long queues at passport control (which I appreciate is more the fault of UK Immigration than BAA/BA). Once through passport control I was out of the terminal in about 10 minutes. Helpful to have an M&S in arrivals for essential food purchases and there is clear signposting to the Heathrow Express and London Underground.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,17th June 2012,unverified,Terminal 5 is great for shopping but seems to be designed to maximise walking. Huge queues at immigration and thoroughly charmless staff.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,R Pinder,Australia,12th June 2012,unverified,Terminal 3. Everything went smoothly for departure very little queuing for security enough seating airside.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,K Lum,United Kingdom,6th June 2012,unverified,An old airport and it shows the carpets are worn and dirt dust over everything. It needs a good clean. Signs are well posted and very clear. Border control - very long wait as is the luggage to be delivered on the carrousel.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,J Tung,United Kingdom,6th June 2012,unverified,T3. Arrived at Heathrow from Hong Kong early morning. I did not expect too much especially Hong Kong is claimed to be one of the best airport. However I was pleasantly surprised. Terminal 3 is old but some money has been spent to renovate the terminal. It is a long walk from the gate to the immigration check but there was no queue for European passport holders. Even for foreigners the queue was moving pretty fast. It took me less than 15 minutes from landing to immigration check which was impressive. Then I went to pick up my luggage and surprisingly they were waiting on the belt. It was a total 20 minutes from the time I landed to the time I got on Heathrow Express. Much more efficiency than Hong Kong. Maybe I was just lucky but I have had really good experience in T1/T3/T5 in the last year. Well done and I am looking forward to visiting Terminal East!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,R Lubbers,United States,6th June 2012,unverified,"Terminal 5 may be very attractive but it is a functional disaster. We were flying Business on BA with a 90 minute connection time. Despite being able to use the fast-track lines it still took a lengthy amount of time to get through the repeat security rigmarole. Our outgoing flight was leaving from a ""C"" gate which meant not only a hike to the train but a train ride then another hike to the gate. We arrived at the gate with only 10 or 15 minutes to spare - no time to visit the BA lounge - there isn't one in the ""C"" section anyway. Would suggest premium class passengers allow a bare minimum of 2 hours of connection - heaven only knows how much time economy passengers should allow - probably at least 3 or 4 hours. Will do my best to avoid connecting at LHR in the future even if it means extra cost or additional inconvenience. Everyone complains about connecting from International at O'Hare but that connection took 1/3 the time and 1/10 the hassle compared to our Heathrow connection."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,M Thomas,United Kingdom,4th June 2012,unverified,Passport control T3 Saturday arrivals 19.00 (quiet time). Hand luggage only no checked bags. Was given a fast track pass and wished I hadn't bothered. The e-gates were closed (not that I can use these yet - old passport) and there were only two people serving the fast track queue. EU citizens were stuck behind more complicated immigration needs. It would have been quicker to join the regular UK/EU queue. The only way Fast track would work properly is either a) all 6 positions open or b) segregate UK-EU and Other in the fast track or c) Fast track only for UK-EU. Broadly speaking the 3 e-gates are an irrelevance and these should have their own queue. And the passport area was hot.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,P Nunn,United Kingdom,4th June 2012,unverified,T3 - old tired if I had a choice of direct flights from anywhere else in the UK I would go there. Very little seats around other then in the expensive food areas long lines for departure security and then got to front at staff change over time and had to wait while they all had a chat to each other. No fast food places before or after security so if your travelling with kids be warned. Plenty of expensive places to eat and as far as I can tell even the snack food is twice the price of the high street. Seats full there were 2 delayed flights. Long walks to some gates. On a plus side on return no lines at passport control but made up for by a long wait for bags to even start arriving.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,H Koehler,United States,31st May 2012,unverified,We had a two-hour layover between Boston and our connecting flight to Dublin. We arrived at Heathrow on time but missed our connection due to nightmare queuing and no less than 4 security checks (although we were so traumatized that we lost count). And we were not alone in missing that flight. On the return trip we had an almost 4 hour layover which allowed us to make our connecting flight but with not that much time to spare. Once again the queues were a nightmare. Heathrow provided us with absolutely the worst airport experience we have ever had bar none. We will never ever fly into this airport again. If you can avoid it do so at any cost. If you can't make sure that you have comfortable walking shoes not too much to carry and plenty of time between connections.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,P Merton,United Kingdom,28th May 2012,unverified,Arrived at terminal three from Hungary. The plane parked up on the apron and a series of buses arrived to transfer passengers to the shabby terminal with a long drive through a building site followed by escalators a broken down travelator and eventually to passport control - mercifully clear but clearly set up to cater for horrendous queues at busy times. The whole thing manages to function only because of goodwill from the staff at the airport but is a national embarrassment.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Gystavo Geraissati,Brazil,14th May 2012,unverified,Flew with BA from Sao Paulo to London arrived at T5 early morning on a Thursday and had a wonderful experience at the airport no queues through border control clean modern beautiful terminal and arrived at Paddington in Central London very easily. In my opinion one of the best airports in the world.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,N Fenton,Switzerland,9th May 2012,unverified,Was a passenger only connecting via Heathrow T5. Stress and frustration is my only experiences at Heathrow. If T5 is the most modern of all the airports terminals then it is really one of the least efficient in the world. Our flight landed on time and although we were not exiting the terminal we went through the security process once again which is something I don't understand as transit passengers we were already scanned in our origin airport (in this case Zurich). This additional screening took over 2hrs and meant we were running for our connecting flight. Fast track was also backed up and provided little benefit. Bottlenecks at every screening points and nothing but frustrated passengers and staff. The layout and ineffective processes cannot help. Thank goodness we were not travelling during the Olympics. Good luck to those who do!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,E Smith,United States,3rd May 2012,unverified,Arrived T3 to connect to T5. Spent 2+ hours in line at one check or another bus trip and more delay at another 2 check lines to finally get to boarding gate at T-5. Only had time for one toilet stop and spent rest of time on line and trying to get to gate. Flight was in final boarding when I arrived and barely made flight. Shameful experience at LHR for the traveller. Would not even consider coming back for an event in London if I had to transit LHR.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Ben Murtagh,United Kingdom,3rd May 2012,unverified,19th April. LHR-EDI. Terminal 5 a delight and massive improvement on other terminals. Modern design and bathed in natural light great views of the airfield. Just wish we had left more time to enjoy the views! Will definitely look forward to using T5 again in the future.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,John Oram,United Kingdom,2nd May 2012,unverified,LHR-LAS-PHX-LHR. Very straightforward passage through T5 on outward journey. One avoidable hitch when we left the lounge for T5B. We were unloaded from transit for an apparent fault and put on the next. The first then left with people on it anyway. Impressively fast on the way back in spite of recent adverse publicity about the UKBF/UKBA. There was a wait for the transit at a busy time. There were queues at immigration but to my surprise IRIS was still in operation. Baggage handling was commendably fast but then a lot of time was wasted waiting for the inadequate and infrequent Hotel Hoppa. A broken toilet had a sloppy sign indicating more that it was not being fixed than it was likely to be any time soon. A key escalator in the still fairly new T5 was not working and another in the same sequence was taped off even though it was running. Heathrow should be very amusing during the Olympics but I don't plan to test that.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,A Schutte,South Africa,29th April 2012,unverified,I arrived at T5 on Wednesday 25 April as non-EU citizen from South Africa. I brought my elderly mother along. However at Border Control we had to queue for 2.5 hours with control officers leaving their desks often for coffee or breaks although there were many passengers waiting. I booked a shuttle service over Internet and our driver left the arrivals hall since we did not show up after 2-3 hours though the flight was not delayed. I had to call the company from the arrivals hall and they finally charged me 20 pounds extra for inconvenience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,S Taylor,United States,29th April 2012,unverified,Whoever is responsible for the queues on 25th April morning should be ashamed of themselves. Expecting weary often hungry and thirsty passengers to stand in line for 1 2 3 hours is just inhumane and unheard of! I travel to and from the USA at least 5 times per year and T5 is the worst border control experience I have ever had by far. I could not believe the chaos and torture that awaited for me when I landed just an absolute joke that it has been allowed to go on. One day a fluke - any more than that sheer neglect.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,H Leong,Hong Kong,29th April 2012,unverified,5:40am arrival on Cathay to T3. 15-20 minute walk from the gate to customs is excessive - a Skytrain is sorely needed. Customs queue was relatively short at about 20-30 minutes due to early arrival. Baggage claim was also fairly quick for the same reason. Terminal interior drab and not spacious all round. Overall very unimpressive for the world's busiest international airport.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Ian Waddell,United Kingdom,29th April 2012,unverified,Arrived at T3 at 05.45 from Singapore. Joined a queue of about 50 people in Fast Track - the queue behind me grew to hundreds in minutes. Two passport officers were dealing with Fast Track arrivals. After about 5 minutes one of the officers closed his desk down and walked off. Totally mysterious. I got through in about 30 minutes - God knows what happened behind.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Steven Wells,United Kingdom,29th April 2012,unverified,Earlier this year I arrived at Terminal 3 of the 32 immigration desks available 3 were occupied by staff - lines were endless and the waiting time unacceptable. I later complained to the Border Agency they didn't even investigate the complaint. It was slow and chaotic and had nothing to do with robust border control if anything it made it seem something of a joke.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Barbara Beresford,United Kingdom,29th April 2012,unverified,Arrived from Dubai early Tuesday morning 24 April tired after night flight with a one year old. Utter chaos through passport control. We were blocked from taking the Baggage collection route and were not advised how to get there. We went to Baby changing room by the baggage pick up which was a big room but only had one baby changing table! How ridiculous is that and what sort of impression does that give to visitors in a brand new Terminal? I wanted to transfer to the Bus Station I searched for signs to the bus station of which there were none was told I took the train to Terminal 1. No information on the train station as to which stop for the Bus Station.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,P Wallace,United Kingdom,27th April 2012,unverified,Arrived back at T5 last night. Transit took an age. No escalators working and then a queue that snaked all the way back from passport to the far end of the terminal. Olympic adverts everywhere - seriously need to get act together.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Kevin Johnson,United Kingdom,25th April 2012,unverified,Just arrived on a flight from Madrid with BA into T5! What a mess! Queue for passports snaked all the way back to the escalators several thousand people no fast track for business class or first class passengers no Iris and no chipped passport readers working! 5 immigration officers on duty when we joined the queue and 3 more trying to police the irate passengers - by the time we reached the front of the queue there was only 1 immigration officer on duty even though there were 500 people behind us! T5 is a national disgrace!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,S Henly,United Kingdom,23rd April 2012,unverified,Regularly travel to T5 for short and long haul travel. Since Christmas queues to get through passport control have seriously diminished the great T5 and BA travel experience. Arrived last night and joined long queue out of the immigration hall and back to the arrival gates. No sign of BAA airport managers just junior temps trying to control the crowds. Cannot understand how the Border Agency and BAA can allow this queuing to happen. Airport is full of adverts telling us that they are ready for the Olympics. Real shame as travel through T5 used to be a real pleasure. On the bright side experience with the airline (BA) remains first class - shame the airport operator lets them down.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Mark Simons,United Kingdom,23rd April 2012,unverified,Arrived back from Istanbul T5 was chaos at passport control with a queue that resembled something at Disneyworld snaking all round the area. Used e-passport queue which took an hour. Clearly woefully understaffed - what a welcome to the UK for foreign visitors - what it will look like during the Olympics does not bare thinking about!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,L Watt,United Kingdom,23rd April 2012,unverified,How will T5 cope with the Olympics? Arrived T5 April 17 from Cape Town. Plane landed at 6.50 escalators were closed because they were worried about masses people of hurting themselves on it so only lifts available to a throng of people. Stood in Immigration line for 90 mins with 3 hungry sleep-deprived kids - partly because there were only 6 out of 24 terminals open. Immigration official said that this was normal for busy periods! Definitely one of the worst terminals for arriving.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,T Hawthorn,United Kingdom,22nd April 2012,unverified,Terminal 5 is a great asset to both British Airways and Heathrow. It is quick pleasant and quiet with a brilliant selection of food and retail outlets the waiting areas are very pleasant also. We always choose to fly BA over Virgin due to T5 especially compared to T3 which Virgin uses.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Dimitris Lioulias,United Arab Emirates,22nd April 2012,unverified,It is appalling how badly the system followed by Heathrow T4 to control passengers' bags works! 5 people sitting around chatting while 1 is leisurely checking customers' bags that are removed for additional checking for no apparent reason. Unbelievably poor experience which is underlined by the employees' suggestion to 'not use their terminal if u don't like it'. I guess airlines are happy to have their customers treated in this way and they do nothing to improve it.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Andrew Mokhov,United States,22nd April 2012,unverified,One of the worst if not the worst major airport out there. Passport control lines at Heathrow are horrendous. Since all employees are unionized they make sure they take their bathroom lunch snack stress relief and other brakes so it is common to see 2 booths manned out of 50 while passengers are hoarded as cattle into lines circling the terminal.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,B Klein,United Kingdom,16th April 2012,unverified,Travel to and from T3 and T5 all the time. T3 is a bit of a hassle and security takes a while but I always use the speedy queue. The thing that makes the difference is people who know what they are doing at security. Terminal 5 is very quick and you can go from club world or first desks straight through to the Concorde lounge almost instantly. Travelling with family to Newark NJ was very easy. It's the airlines that can make or break a journey and every single American airline that leaves Heathrow is appalling. Coming back into the UK is usually quick if you are a British citizen. Using e passport gates is very easy.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Mark Wilkins,United Kingdom,16th April 2012,unverified,MAN-LHR-SIN-LHR-MAN. Used T1 for MAN flights T3 for SIN ones. T1 arrival good and T3 departure and security checks were cleared quickly with minimal fuss. T3 does feel claustrophobic airside but good shop selection and used lounge which was good for money paid. Different story arriving T3 can only echo other comments. Passport control is a mess - IRIS working but big queue other self-scan gates not working. Luggage belt failed 5 mins into delivery due to strollers jamming it - passengers eventually cleared the blockage when it became apparent no baggage handlers would do so after 20 minutes. After another 45 mins bags arrived. T1 departure to MAN fine apart from the need to clear 2 security checks for the internal flight with an eye scan check taken at each station this is when no check needed for international flights? Given T3 experience can't see how it will cope with Olympic traffic unless problems addressed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,S Smith,United Kingdom,14th April 2012,unverified,Flew out through T3. A dump. You enter airside through a massive retail area and there is insufficient seating. The low ceilings create a real claustrophobic atmosphere. If you want breakfast etc eat landslide. The outlets are a lot less busy and a lot more pleasant.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,8,R Crossan,United Kingdom,11th April 2012,unverified,Arrived at T3 from HEL flew out from T5 to MAN. Immigration queues satisfyingly short. Renovation work means the T3-T5 bus trip isn't the most glamorous but they're making the best of it. BA Galleries Lounge at T5 could do with some more inspiring food choices. A long time since I've been through LHR and a few horror stories had me scared but this was a painless experience entirely.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Alan May,Canada,11th April 2012,unverified,Travelled through Terminal 5 on 31 Mar arriving at 2.15 pm from Canada. Immigration Control was horrible. It took 2.5 hours to clear through the non-EU non-UK queue. On the way home a week later I was stuck in one of the lifts from the Underground to Departures level for 25 minutes. We also had to board a bus to a remote stand for departure. For a new terminal using a remote stand for a Long Haul International flight is quite poor. Otherwise the terminal is really nice! Clean lots of food shopping and plenty of seats. The first contact arriving is the Immigration Hall. It's gives a really poor impression.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,10th April 2012,unverified,Flew in and out over Easter weekend. Inbound the immigration queues were horrendous as predicted. No excuse - just poor planning and management. An embarrassment to be British if this is people's first impression of the UK.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,9th April 2012,unverified,"Arrived at T5 from MAN then T1 to WAW return. Mid-morning outward flight; no major problems before departure but the flight departed 35 minutes late. Facilities still good after security. Staff unusually friendly and polite. 3.5 hour layover upon return to await flight to MAN. After my connecting flight was called I learned I had used the wrong ""flight connections"" channel thus missing passport control after landing from WAW. Customs and security staff were understanding and helpful and ensured I did not miss my connection. Overall my impression is that customer service is improving at LHR. Cleanliness much better than my last flight from T1."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Jane Green,France,9th April 2012,unverified,T5 is a pleasant experience modern and spacious though would like to see more eateries landside. Terminal 3 - cramped no natural light long walk to the gates. T4 and T1 average. Iris is used at immigration and costs nothing to add to your UK passport. Good links to and from London and frequent public transport to the nearby hotels. Unfortunately getting between terminals is a real pain in the backside. The bus service takes a long time and is every half hour or so the trains only runs every 15 mins leaving you stranded on the featureless miserable platform drumming your fingers if you have a tight connection.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Simon Smith,United Kingdom,4th April 2012,unverified,I have travelled through Heathrow twice in the last few weeks (T3 T5). In most respects the airport is fine and in particular departure security queues are much quicker than a few years ago. The problem is immigration control. On one occasion the queues were bad on the other appalling - even for EU passport holders. Lots of desks were unstaffed and the queue for the new e-passport gates seems to take even longer than the queue for the staffed desks. I travel around Europe for work almost every week and UK airports consistently have the worst immigration queues anywhere.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,R Sample,United Kingdom,2nd April 2012,unverified,I fly into T5 regularly and transit to T1 for a domestic flight. Security is a nightmare. There are 10-12 scanners at T1 security only 3 or 4 are ever manned no matter how big the queue. Same story at the photographic check 6 camera positions only 1 is ever manned. If you arrive on a flight that is late you have no chance of making your connection if less than 2 hours. Security staff are generally very rude. Rules seem to change on a daily basis.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Tim Collins,United States,2nd April 2012,unverified,"I flew into Terminal 5 en route from California (via Dallas) to India. Navigating through Flight Connections was easy and I was through security in under 10 minutes. It is impressive in size although was surprised how ""unfinished"" some of the architecture is. Impressed by the size of the terminal and the large number of shops and restaurants. My biggest complaint is that T5 is simply not designed for long-haul transit passengers. Even if you do find a relatively quiet area there is a constant barrage of PA announcements. Since I was not a premium passenger I could not use the lounges and there are no pay lounges. Seating is uncomfortable and hard. It was such a contrast with an airport like Singapore Changi."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,M Andersen,United States,21st March 2012,unverified,Flew into T5 on March 7 mid-afternoon to find passport control lines extremely long for non-UK passport holders. There were only 2 then 3 passport officers for plane loads of visitors. There were 24 un-manned desks. The EU UK and Iris Scan lines had passport officers and no lines. The Fast-Track line was closed which made no sense to those who had paid for that service. It took 2.5 hours for our group to get through. Passengers grumbled quietly and behaved patiently. No special assistance offered to travelers with young children and babies. I did not feel welcome at all to the UK with that queue and do not recommend coming back!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,19th March 2012,unverified,Last week used T5 for 2 arrivals and 1 departure. No lines for check-in or security well organised boarding called by row. Toilets clean and well stocked. Eateries are good quality plentiful and not crowded. The only minus was immigration line on arrival. First time I was out of the terminal within 15 minutes after flight next time I queued for 35 minutes or so. Bags are always waiting on the belt.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Greg Guthridge,Canada,12th March 2012,unverified,Flew into T5 on March 9th 2012 and spent nearly 2 hours at passport control. They had only 2 people in the Non-EU Non-UK line. At one point around 2pm both employees just got up and left (coffee break)? For the next 15 mins we all stood in horror as there was nobody! The crowd of people began yelling and pleading for somebody to return. I've honestly never seen such a mis-managed airport passport control in my life! Whoever manages the Customs at Heathrow is seriously damaging perception of Heathrow BA and London.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,J Irwin,United States,7th March 2012,unverified,"Flew into Terminal 5 Jan 2012. Waited in the Immigration queue for 1.5 hours! The UK passport holders booths had already processed everyone in the UK line and were sitting around talking while non-UK passport holders area had only two manned booths. Why some supervisor couldn't move workers to the Non-UK side is beyond me. After an hour an Australian man started screaming to see a supervisor. When that supervisor came over to the line she told him in no uncertain terms that they only had two officers. This ""problem"" has serious repercussions - business is being affected it makes me think twice about spending my tourist dollar in a country that apparently just doesn't care."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,5th March 2012,unverified,Sunday evening departure T1. The usual huge queues at bmi/Lufthansa check-in desks and the area is still uncomfortably overheated/under ventilated. 10 minutes to clear security. However things improve rapidly after security with everything in working order clean and tidy and conditions are much more comfortable even with large numbers of pax. Flight departed on time and arrived early. Still good airside but continues to leave a lot to be desired landside.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,J Henson,United Kingdom,5th March 2012,unverified,Departure on morning of 23 Feb from T3 - very good selection of shops both land and airside; helpful to have Travelex pick-up landside right next to the security lanes. Security line was relatively long but was processed quick quickly although not within the supposed 5 minute target. T3 always seems very busy in the central terminal area and still appears to be handling too many passengers for its size. Terminal seemed clean but a bit dated in places. Long walk to gate.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Sally Symmonds,United Kingdom,3rd March 2012,unverified,Arrived at Terminal 3 from Bangkok. When we got to the immigration hall it was an absolute nightmare. Even with fast track passes we queued over an hour to pass through immigration - a lovely holiday was spoilt by this unnecessary delay. The borders agency need to have more staff on at the terminals. What's going to happen later this year when it's the Olympic games - it will be a total farce. If I were an overseas tourist I would avoid Heathrow airport at all costs.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,J Pickard,Canada,27th February 2012,unverified,"Arrived at T5 on a Wednesday morning in Feb and it took over 2 hours to be processed by immigration agents! There were only 3 wickets open we watched 5 underworked agents several of them idle in the EU/UK passport section. None of them we diverted to the ""All Other Passports"" sections and no new agents were put on duty. The many personnel assigned to manage the lines spent their time handing out complaint forms and trying to calm frustrated passengers. It would be better to simply assign more people to processing incoming travellers."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Bill Atkins,United States,27th February 2012,unverified,T5 has great potential to be world-class but does not deliver it due to poor planning. The whole transfer process needs to be rethought. There is too much waiting in line for the various boarding pass/passport procedures - more agents needed. Transfer security screening is the same nightmare it was in the old BA multi-terminal days. Many lines of passengers trying to merge then capacity controls on the escalator as there is a huge bottleneck at the top of it. Nothing good can be said of the screening area and staff though I feel sure they are grumpy and aggressive for the same reason the passengers are. It would not take a great deal to improve this but have seen little progress to date.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,M Eggleton,United Kingdom,16th February 2012,unverified,Good all round airport. I've mainly used T4 (international) which seems a bit cramped and there always seems to be minimal seating available. Fairly clean as you would expect from one of the worlds biggest airports but I didn't see many staff about and those I did were chatting to each other not fussed about travellers.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,T Collier,United Kingdom,15th February 2012,unverified,"Flew in/out of T5 at the weekend and its probably my worst experience to date of using T5. Luggage seemed to take forever to come off the plane - its a UK domestic flight so not exactly far to travel through the airport. Arrived at check-in area yesterday morning and in the ""north"" area there were 3 check-in desks open out of 15 - not on especially as it was extremely busy since it was the first day of the English mid-term holidays and the place was heaving! I sorely wished I hadn't decided to put my bag into the hold! Thankfully security was fairly quiet and was being kept moving by the BAA staff. As per usual the flight to ABZ was late. Plus points in that they did have the gate number up much earlier than normal so there wasn't the last minute dash to the gate although no explanation/announcement that there was going to be a delay!"
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Georgina Howe,United Kingdom,15th February 2012,unverified,After a very pleasant flight home I was disgusted to have to queue for over half an hour at border control this was my first visit to T5 .There was only two manned. Surely staff there must know when planes are arriving. It completely spoilt the end of my journey.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Andrea Giannelli,Italy,6th February 2012,unverified,Bad treatment from ground personnel. They seem to be there by chance bored and annoyed by travellers. Not comfortable at all. Luggage check is too long compared to other airports.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,A Griggs,United Kingdom,2nd February 2012,unverified,Cramped buildings with lots of lost passengers with no one to help them. Dark interior probably to hide the problems. Security queues too long although security scanners are not being used - although Terminal 5 is ok as only British Airways uses it. Taxes to use LHR are far too high and compared with other main international competitors taxes are much lower giving LHR a disadvantage.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Barter,United Kingdom,30th January 2012,unverified,Terminal 3A dreadful first view of the UK. No fast track facility although airline had issued us with fast track tickets. Assistance booked but wheelchair only took me half way to baggage handling. Everywhere was scruffy. I flew in from Bangkok where the airport was clean well staffed and efficient. Cant we do better than this?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,23rd January 2012,unverified,"I used T5 and T4 for arrival and departure. T5 was very good on departure with lots of eateries and places to sit and relax. However arrival was shockingly bad. I had to queue at immigration for 1hr 55 mins with only 2-3 desks manned. I don't believe that border control staff don't know flight schedule and are not prepared to see a couple of B747 arrive about 3 pm. Same happened couple months ago when I arrived on the same flight at the same time. Same experience: lots of staff to manage the queue and almost no one to process passengers. EU desks even when empty don't invite ""all other passports"" to ease congestion. Is LHR going to become a second CDG? At T4 immigration line was managed well with digital signage system."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Ken Lee,United Kingdom,18th December 2011,unverified,I use LHR often as most international flights pass through this airport. However I would not use it if I have the chance. The queues at the 'All Other Passports' section are very long and I often have to spend more than one hour in the queues. The departure lounge at T3 is very crowded and shopping facilities are lacking. The only plus about Heathrow is that it is served by the London Underground which makes it convenient if there are no strikes or engineering works.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,L Lindstrand,Sweden,13th December 2011,unverified,T5. The queuing system for arrivals (passport check to security with the escalator) is totally amateurish and unacceptable - it is much too cramped poorly designed and there are at least 3 waiting points. The amount of staff required to control passenger flow is above normal the security queues block passages to other queues because of lack of space. Seeing the amount of space the airport authorities devoted to shopping versus passenger security clearly you consider passengers cash cows.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Matsuda,United Kingdom,3rd December 2011,unverified,Arrived at T4 from Tokyo via Moscow. Our flight landed around 20.00 earlier than scheduled but a long walk to immigration. At immigration there was a long queue for non-European section. More than 10 gates were open but suddenly all gates except 2 or 3 closed at 21.00 as officers finished their shift even with hundreds people queuing still. We were so angry. After queuing 1.5 hrs I managed to go through immigration. Also Heathrow does not offer free WiFi while many Asian airports do.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,N Werner,Switzerland,2nd December 2011,unverified,Flew in to T1 and departed from there. If you fly LX it takes at least 20 mins to get to immigration and the walk seems to go on forever. Immigration is usually quick and if you have a biometric passport you can use the e-gates. Baggage claim is functional and seems efficient enough. The good thing is that the tube runs frequently from T1 but again the walk is rather long in comparison to T5. Check-in efficient but not friendly. Departure is fine but security can take quite long at times. Airside there are some shops and overall it is quite good. However the walk to the gates are again endless. I think T5 is still better.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,1st December 2011,unverified,Sunday evening flight T1 to MAN. 10 minute queue at check-in but staff friendly polite and apologetic for the delay which is unusual. No queue at security who were also unusually friendly and polite. Flight over 1.5 hours late due to delays earlier in the day. Facilities are still very good airside.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,K Chan,Hong Kong,30th November 2011,unverified,HKG afternoon arrival at T3. Non-peak hour arrival meant no queue at passport control. However T3 did look a little aged and the rude immigration officer at passport control made a really bad impression to the airport and to the city. Evening AMS departure at T5. A brand new terminal with no queue for check in and security checks. Big and spacious terminal with plenty of shops to spend the time while waiting for flight.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Hugh Thomas,United Kingdom,24th November 2011,unverified,I used Terminal 5 for the first time last week - and what a disappointment! The check-in area is spacious and I was through security in record time but the main departure area felt cramped and crowded. Yet again there are too many shops and too few places to eat - another shopping mall. If BA buys BMI's slots where are all the extra passengers going to go?
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Peter Cullen,United Kingdom,21st November 2011,unverified,In the past 9 months I have used terminals 1 3 and 5. T5 is by far the best and despite its size it feels quite relaxed and human. I had no problem with queues except at immigration and even those were not too bad. The only downside appears to be that it can be a very long time between leaving the gate and taking off I think it was about 20 minutes for a 45 minute flight to Brussels. T1 is not too bad though it feels like a crowded shopping mall but there are quieter places to sit the waiting areas at the departure gates are rather depressing. Queues for security and immigration were both fairly lengthy. T3 for check-in and arrivals last week was quite good but once in the departure area it is an unpleasant environment: crowded with insufficient seating and no view. Security was efficient and with a chipped passport I got through immigration quickly. As a whole Heathrow feels what it is a mish-mash of parts that have been added over 50 years with no overall plan or identity and some parts very tired.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,7,Stuart Ferguson,United Kingdom,17th November 2011,unverified,Used terminal 5 on a domestic flight to Glasgow. Check-in was pain free quick and efficient more than likely due to us using the fast track lane. Getting through security was a slow process due to the fact BA use the one security zone for both domestic and international flights which meant long lines of passengers and more stringent checks. Once past security terminal 5 has a lot to offer plenty of places to eat and drink and lots of shops. The only thing is how expensive everything is a lot of shops sell luxury goods and the sandwich shops are extortionate. I know BA is a more upmarket choice but a few cheaper options would be nice.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Bob Motto,United Kingdom,14th November 2011,unverified,Arrived into LHR T1 on United Airlines from LAX. Flight arrived early very long walk from United gates to immigration. Immigration was very slow arrived around 1pm with only two immigration officers serving the EU passports which took nearly 40 minutes to clear. International passports not a lot better lots of empty desks that should be manned when passenger numbers get busy - there seemed to be more people grooming the lines as opposed to manning the desks. Baggage was ready to pick up once boarder control had been cleared.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,4th November 2011,unverified,I arrived at Terminal 4 on KLM things have improved dramatically. Arrival gate levels nicely lit and all the travelators work. Immigration has automated line management system and easy to understand voice announcement. Bag on the belt in 4 minutes. Refurbished arrivals hall clean toilets refreshed lighting improved taxi stand signage - I was off the airport 20 minutes after flight.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,9,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,22nd October 2011,unverified,Flew to and from Terminal 1 in October. A much-improved terminal though still busy and some queuing at various points. On return a short but slow-moving passport and immigration queue and then a long wait for luggage even though we were nearly the last off the plane and had seen the luggage coming off whilst we were still in our seats!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,T Ferreira,United Kingdom,10th October 2011,unverified,T4 a good terminal with plenty of shops cafes some with runway views. Lots of signs telling you where to go. Security was good polite staff. On return baggage reclaim was slow nearly 1/2 hr wait. Good connections to underground etc.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,6,Ross Clark,United Kingdom,2nd October 2011,unverified,T4 is okay facilities are limited and the design means a lot of walking. T1 was another matter - coming in from KUL I got through to the T1 Flight Connections Centre well enough but then got in the wrong queue for border control wasting several minutes because the signage did not indicate that it was only for journeys terminating at London - there was a separate queue for border control for connecting trips. This is also about yet another change of procedure by the Borders Agency. OTOH the security checks were quick.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,10,Rob Payne,United Kingdom,22nd September 2011,unverified,Terminal 5 on a Sunday afternoon. It seemed really busy but bag drop time was a couple of minutes about 5 mins to get through Security then the underground train to B satellite. Plenty of shops and drink/food outlets. Boarded 30 mins ahead and left on time. We returned 2 weeks later around midday on the Sunday 10 min hold which appears to be the minimum likely. Used the auto immigration desk we scanned our own passports and were through in about 3 mins staff on hand should we have had a problem. Suitcases were on the carousel waiting for us. Getting the underground train from B satellite to the main terminal was a problem in that they automatic doors kept trying to close but people were forcing their way on the trains causing the doors to keep opening. However we were heading out of Heathrow on the Heathrow express to Paddington 20 mins after we arrived at the gate not bad for a fully loaded 747 from Seattle. So all in all a good experience of Terminal 5 at Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,A Mackrill,Australia,21st September 2011,unverified,First transit through Terminal 5 and it is a great building. If you get the chance then the BA Galleries Lounge is lovely. As with many airport terminals security is the weakest link the transit security area queues here were woeful and I thought it was a quiet time early afternoon on a Saturday. In T5 everything has to go in large trays to go through x-ray and unlike most other places that includes carry on bags. Many people do not travel often and so some patience should be offered to them when this is all new to them. I just saw rude and arrogant security staff barking at people time after time as we waited and watched.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,S Fahy,United Kingdom,19th September 2011,unverified,"T3 Departure/Arrival Sept 2011 - JAL to Tokyo. Drop off is generally chaotic and overcrowded check-in areas are dark and dingy although JAL Business Class check-in never has queues. Security ""fast-track"" is anything but although it has improved recently. Airside you come through security into the duty free shop. Not into a shopping area but into the shop itself you have to fight your way through people stopping to look at goods in an area crowded with display stands. All the retail outlets/restaurants have long queues gate areas are small and crowded. Arriving back is no better - on two occasions this year I've arrived back to find the queue for passports going outside the immigration hall and back up the ramp towards the planes. Many people here have complained about the lines for non-EU passport holders but I can assure you it is not much better for EU passport holders - took me 40 minutes to get through on Sunday. Only good thing is that our bags had arrived by the time we got through but had all been piled into the open area next to the belt by staff to prevent the belt being overloaded so finding your bag was something of a challenge. On leaving the baggage hall the arrivals area is absolute chaos you can barely get through and the lifts cannot cope with the volume of passengers. This terminal simply cannot cope with the volume of passengers."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,T Moilanen,Finland,11th September 2011,unverified,No free WiFi available and all the cafes and stores are located so that you can't see the tarmac. Looks a little dated as well. Service was smooth and efficient and no long queues. Good connections to London city centre as well.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,B Atkins,United States,10th September 2011,unverified,My first T5 transfer experience which I could call acceptable and that was only because for some strange reason there were virtually no passengers at the usual peak 6.30 am time. I have always maintained that the transfer security area is woefully inadequate and this was the proof. An unusually pleasant experience for all the wrong reasons.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Andrew Pickles,Australia,8th September 2011,unverified,Terminal 3 while improved is still too small to cope with the volume of passengers. Maybe things will improve when they re-open T1 and T2 to full capacity. Still a very inadequate airport in terms of number of check-in desks space ambience and light. Plenty - maybe too much shopping.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,A Coulson,Gambia,4th September 2011,unverified,T5 out to HK this weekend. Checked in online and through security quickly. They should give earlier warning about belts computers and pockets as some people are taken by surprise when getting to the x-ray. Restaurants although expensive are a great alternative to inflight catering. When you go to B or C gates the facilities are not so good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,P Speer,United Kingdom,3rd September 2011,unverified,Arrived T3. Used new e-passport gates but didn't work with new passport so had to use agent (about 50% did). About 1 hour to wait for bags to arrive. Air Canada arrival lounge good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,J Padmanabhan,United States,1st September 2011,unverified,Used the airport back to Washington DC from London on United. Terminals are old and look tired. Substandard facilities and the walk to the United gate was long. Little to no facilities near the gates.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,N Werner,Switzerland,1st September 2011,unverified,Arrival in to T5 was not bad although the line for border control took around 15min to clear. Once through it took another 15 min to get our bags which seemed a bit long. However after that we were on the tube in a few minutes and it is far better than T1 T2 T3 which takes a long time to walk to the tube station. Airport is very modern and airy and gives a good impression. Departing we arrived with the tube again and the lift to the departure level is efficient you don't have to walk a lot with your baggage to reach check-in desks. Check-in was quick but the VAT refund did take a while as they only staffed the desks with 2 people. Security was quick and the shopping choices are great. Boarding was on time and it's great to leave from terminal 5A.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,29th August 2011,unverified,I used it for arrival and departure 2 weeks ago. T5 both ways. I liked the new C gates concourse and the train system that seems to be efficient despite quite slow. Food and duty free selection is impressive. On departure no queues anywhere. On arrival it was a long immigration line for non-eu passport holders. Despite many wide bodies landing at the same time they only staffed 12 positions. As a result I had 1hr 15mins wait to reach border control. After immigration I picked up my bag (had already been on the belt) and got bus to the city. Overall processing time on arrival was around 1hr 35 mins. They must know their flight schedule and should expect that some 300 non-EU citizens (in our case Japanese) arrive at the same time every day and there is a need to staff desks appropriately.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Ivan Markovic,Canada,25th August 2011,unverified,For such a large airport it was easy to get around with clear and direct signage. Terminal 5 clean and modern. I wish that they use trains instead of buses to link to each terminal as the bus seems to take a while. Terminal 3 was modern with pleasant service. The food court had lot's of choices many shops around the airport. Easy currency exchange from pounds to euros around stores. It's a great airport to have a layover with plenty to do while you wait.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,B Lichfield,United Kingdom,18th August 2011,unverified,Used Heathrow T5 a couple of weeks ago for domestic flights fast check in good security - noticed the family lane with cartoons on the actual scanner good idea to calm children. Excellent departures area. all in all impressed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Kevin Tunnicliffe,United Kingdom,18th August 2011,unverified,Terminal Five. When we departed Heathrow everything worked well and efficiently until we found that we had to be bussed to the aircraft. On our return however the new satellite C terminal had opened and be were able to disembark along a jetty. Short monorail ride into the main terminal and through immigration in a couple of minutes. Bags just being loaded onto the carousel so disembarked processed and baggage collected in under 30 mins. Well done Heathrow and BA.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Sewell,United Kingdom,10th August 2011,unverified,T5 during a peak travelling period. Queue for bag drop was satisfactory - check-in staff efficient. No queue for security and went through with no problems. Not the friendliest of staff but wasn't expecting much. Great view of the runway and flights taking off made the wait to board quite pleasant. Facilities in the terminal were adequate.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,A Hickling,United Kingdom,7th August 2011,unverified,I used T5 at LHR on a recent trip to New York. Check in was swift although Fast Track could have been quicker. Lounge facilities were excellent and there is a wide choice of shopping and dining facilities. Adequate seating at the gates and the transit system is really efficient.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Henson,United Kingdom,7th August 2011,unverified,Used Heathrow for domestic flights twice in the last week. Terminal Five clean bright and airy but seemed to be struggling with the number of passengers. Long wait at bag drops stressed out check-in staff long queues at security and food outlets very busy/crowded. Lack of seating at gate - myself and many other passengers were left standing for a long time as the flight was delayed. Great range of shops but a long walk down to A19/A20 if you are in a hurry! Both flights were delayed a considerable amount of time once boarded due to runway congestion - delighted to hear that mixed mode is going to be used on an introductory basis. Used T1 on 7 August and security queue was much shorter - was through in a few minutes and the terminal seemed far less chaotic. Heathrow is improving but is inconsistent.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Meena Ram,India,4th August 2011,unverified,Horrible queuing system. They need more staff at the UKBA counter. I had a wait of 3.5hrs to pass through immigration in a very hot and humid hall. Inefficient and rude.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,I Wong,Malaysia,1st August 2011,unverified,Arrived at T4 on an Etihad flight from Abu Dhabi in the evening. The queue at Border Control was very long and only less than 10 counters out of 30+ available counters were manned. It took me 2 hrs to get through Border Control (Foreign Passport Section) and I missed my ground connection to my final destination.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,P Nunn,United Kingdom,1st August 2011,unverified,Used T3. long line for security little free seating in main departures area due to a small refit. Long walk to plane food outlets very expensive. On arrival better shorter walk no passport control line to speak of and bags coming up when arrived at the belt. Trolleys hard to find in baggage area.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Tatiana Sedochenkova,United States,17th July 2011,unverified,Running frantically to catch a connecting flight on the other side of the airport I was stopped at the security checkpoint and searched. They got into my bag and took out a ziplock bag of medicine that I had for my high blood pressure. The medicine was in liquid form and was accompanied by a doctor's prescription. The airport security took it away and said it was not permitted on the plane. They said that it would be sent to me and gave me a ticket receipt. When I went online it turned out they wanted me to pay $70 to send the medicine from England to Latvia. A complete rip-off. So now I won't have my medicine the entire time I'm in Latvia and will have to get more only when I am back in the States.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Nelson Yap,Australia,17th July 2011,unverified,Terminal 4 is new and very efficient. Through customs security and detax (claiming back 20% VAT for tourists) in 20 mins! You can't do better than that! But Wifi is not free and the paid services are slow and expensive at 9.95 pounds a session should not be called broadband because they are not broadband. Maybe 128k speed. But signage is good airport is clean staff are good too. Terminal 3 I landed at T3 and had connecting flights at T3 very efficient. I had 2 hrs 10 mins to do a connecting flight and I was panicking I would miss my flight. But nothing to worry. Got off the plane my Virgin Atlantic flight through customs collected my luggage checked through my British Airways flight to a European destination pass security in 30 mins! American airports can learn from this. Last time I was connecting in LAX-JFK and it took 2.5 hrs.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,G Calafiore,Australia,10th July 2011,unverified,You really have to consider LHR as 4 separate airports according to which terminal you use. Arrival from JFK at T5; and absolute joy. Clean bright terminal with plenty of space and well-laid out. UK border control inwards a breeze through the EU passports line (queued for less than 5 mins after 0700 arrival on a Sat) and baggage already waiting at carousel. Reached the big bright arrivals hall in less than 30 mins after touchdown. At an airport like LHR such a feat is impressive. Whether departing or arriving T5 is always a pleasure. Easy transfer to T3 with the LHR express but T3 itself is another story. It is cramped and all thoroughfares are jammed with throngs of pax mostly with overloaded baggage trollies. Seating is an option only if you buy something at one of the food outlets. Queuing at security is efficient thanks to the staff who constantly keep watch and regularly re-distribute the queue. I never sit in the central seating area/food court. Too much like a shopping mall and always unpleasantly overcrowded and noisy. I always go through late enough to have my gate number posted on the FID's and head straight there and it's usually fairly painless. Queues security etc. are all fairly tedious I agree but considering that LHR is the world's busiest airport it performs well. If planned around realistic transfer times a transit through LHR can be painless.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,K Sekhon,Canada,6th July 2011,unverified,Make sure you leave enough room if you are connecting here especially T5. I had a 4 hr layoff for an onboard connecting international flight. Got off the plane (at another terminal I assume) took the elevator down to the subway station (train every 5 mins) and onto T5. Security took forever. The airport is designed nicely with standard seats and some comfy couches (good for a quick nap if you can get one for yourself). Decent amount of shopping and food available. Well signed and easy to find your way.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,A Futeran,Australia,26th June 2011,unverified,Used terminal 3 5 times within 2 weeks. It's pretty awful by world standards don’t really care though that the distances between transport services are long or that shopping is really basic or that it is really crowded I care like most others how long it takes to get through customs and immigration on arrival. What a contrast after arriving on a Friday morning from Australia I was through in no time at all. Come one week later on a Sunday night transferring through London for one night arriving from Madrid and we spent longer in the queue to get into the customs hall than the flight time itself! No security issue just pure volume of numbers. Strongly recommend if you are an elderly traveller you request airline wheelchair assistance if using this airport more than 2 hours on your feet after a long flight is not a pleasant welcome. Hopefully when terminal 2 re-opens this will take some pressure off but for now this is a terminal that should be avoided at all costs!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Bill Atkins,United States,19th June 2011,unverified,I don't go to the airport to eat or shop - I just want it to be smooth and efficient and I am still not sure that T5 fits the bill yet. The transit process can be very painful early in the morning and even when slow around 5pm the security proved to be tedious compared with Asian airports of a similar size - the system and space allowed for it is not adequate for the volume. One huge improvement is the addition of a Fast Track boarding lane at all the domestic/shorthaul gates for Executive Club Silver and Gold members.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,D Hartono,Indonesia,16th June 2011,unverified,I think this is a nice airport check-in very nice and also very fast. Large variety of restaurants and cafes and also has a spacious terminal. Very Very clean terminal.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Tung,United Kingdom,13th June 2011,unverified,Flew BA to Nice from T5. Again excellent airport not too busy (despite a lack of staff at BA luggage drop and certainly not helpful when some passengers simply ignored rules for luggage allowance and ended up arguing with the staff). Same situation in the security control - the staff were friendly enough but there were a few naive passengers who thought it was too much trouble to take off their jacket or insist they wanted to carry their own drink onto the plane. Apart from this the process was smooth. As usual once you are through the security T5 is a fantastic place. We had a meal at Wagamama - a very spacious restaurant very clean although the staff were grumpy and not efficient. The flight was delayed by 1 hour but at this airport you can always find somewhere to eat/drink or just do window shopping. It remains one of my favorite European airport terminals.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Henson,United Kingdom,12th June 2011,unverified,I flew out of Heathrow Terminal 3 on 27 May and back through T3 arrivals on 12 June. This terminal seems to be coping much better since the reallocation of some airlines to other terminals (notably T4). Good range of shops and restaurants. I don't agree with previous comments that all of the places to eat are expensive (Boots Eat Starbucks and Wetherspoons are all relatively cheap the compromise is more on quality than price). The main problems I encountered were very long walks to the gate - arguably unavoidable at Heathrow very long immigration queues long security queues (I was not processed in less than 5 minutes as Heathrow claim most people are) and the passages leading from arrivals to underground station were very drab.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Nigel Garth,Canada,9th June 2011,unverified,LHR-YYZ -Connected through Heathrow on my way home to Toronto. Needed wheelchair assistance and had to wait over an hour for someone to finally show up and almost missed my flight terrible service. If you need wheel chair assistance at this airport don't expect much.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,J Webb,United Kingdom,8th June 2011,unverified,Terminal 3 an extended overcrowded waiting room surrounded by overpriced shops. Food prices much higher airside than landside. Still do not have to pay for Plastic Bags at security yet.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Simon Smith,United Kingdom,5th June 2011,unverified,Couldn't really complain about T5 apart from some very long walks. Good range of facilities and easy access from the train. Some of the staff at the retail outlets need some proper training I was told rudely to get shifted from the seating near EAT as it would be closing in 5 minutes (this was at 9pm). If the airport is open then so should the outlets. On return passport control was quick and baggage delivery was prompt. Less than an hour after arrival I was in the bus to Gatwick and on the M25.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,E Crouse,Brazil,1st June 2011,unverified,T5 is great with all possible facilities quick passport control and efficient security control. Even for a long transfer there is hardly a moment to get bored of watching other people or planes arriving and departing. Seating plenty and bathrooms are clean. For Airport standards I think the prices of the restaurants shops and cafe's are reasonable. This is one of the better airports in Europe.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,30th May 2011,unverified,London Heathrow Terminal 4. For my departure the terminal was working well check-in was very quick boarding pass check queues were handled fast and security took only minutes. It was nice to see them handing out free plastic liquids bags for those who did not have one (other airports now charge very high prices for cheap plastic bags). Airside there was plenty of room to sit down and the appearance of charging stations for electrical items is welcome. Fresh drinking water is readily available near the toilets (unlike Gatwick North where it is not). My return arrival experience was extraordinarily efficient and landing to landside time with luggage was 30 minutes.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,28th May 2011,unverified,T1 is still a good place to fly from. It is worth noting that there is an separate entrance to security from the BMI area which is useful when the main entrance is busy. I flew Aer Lingus and their flights depart from gates 77 - 90. This is effectively one long corridor and when there are flights disembarking security doors shut this corridor so be careful if you are planning a trip to the loo - you could miss your flight!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Tanya Bailey,United Kingdom,28th May 2011,unverified,T5 domestic to international was fast and smooth with 1 small security check to reach the main terminal area. Airside has plenty of eateries to suit most tastes & pockets with prices slightly higher than in the landside shops. Everything feels modern and clean with huge windows to watch the aircraft. I imagine that in summer it could get very warm with more passengers crowding into the building but there were plenty of service personnel on hand to maintain cleanliness and assist any lost passengers. Each of the departure gate areas B & C are self contained areas with small shops and toilets. International to domestic took a lot longer and we had to wait for a much longer period to get back into the terminal building. Out of all the terminals at Heathrow this feels the most comfortable and customer friendly and it makes me more inclined to use British Airways because of this terminal.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,T Bos,Netherlands,24th May 2011,unverified,Airport is to big. If you have to travel between several terminals. In general the people working on the airport are friendly and helpful however security people in terminal 4 not helpful.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Graham Pierce,United Kingdom,18th May 2011,unverified,T5. Teething problems a thing of the past and everything now seems to work smoothly. On the outward journey we stopped off and registered for iris recognition; third time lucky as the office seems to be closed more often than not. (tucked away just after Security at the south end). The machine took about 20 + attempts before it got a satisfactory record of my iris. Overall possibly not worth the hassle unless you regularly travel through the few UK airports that use it. Coming back we ended up outside the yet-to-be opened C Building so had to be bussed to the main terminal. Hold baggage was on the carousel by the time we got there. Apart from that overall a very good experience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,K Ward,United Kingdom,8th May 2011,unverified,T4 Quick and efficient service at check-in security and then boarding. T4 has an abundance of shopping facilities and is large and spacious. Check-in had minimal queues that processed quickly as did the security queues. Boarding took a little longer but wasn't to long. On arrival baggage reclaim took a long time - at least 30mins this was annoying after a 10 hour flight! Customs and Immigration was busy but queues were processed fast and efficiently with a maximum wait of about 10mins. The airport information desk were fantastic in helping out with any queries.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Henson,United Kingdom,8th May 2011,unverified,Terminal 5 - satisfactory if not great. Passport queue was immense. I have travelled through Heathrow many times and seldom seen it this long. Waited nearly 40 minutes for someone to glance at my passport. I'm aware that infrastructure will be strained during Bank Holidays peak travel periods but UK Border Agency must be aware of predicted passenger numbers and should cater accordingly. Terminal clean and bright good connections to Heathrow Express and tube in arrivals.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Alan Wan,United Kingdom,2nd May 2011,unverified,I rarely use T4 but I used it recently and find it much more pleasurable than a T3 it seems more open and less crowded. We ate at one of the restaurants that provided a decent breakfast. However buying a sandwich to take on board was limited to Starbucks and Costa. A Pret or Eat would have been most welcome. On arrival the lines for immigration were long but processed fairly quickly.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Hassett,Australia,30th April 2011,unverified,Flew in and out of terminal three. Not the prettiest terminal in the world but it works. Good signage on arrival to the underground. Fast check in with Qantas on departure and security was a breeze with professional and friendly staff. There are plenty of shops and seating to keep you occupied but I chose to use the Servisair lounge. Good value at £18 with drinks snacks and wifi included plus a good view of the runway. Boarding the A380 was fast and efficient. Heathrow can be a bit of a challenge but I couldn't fault it on this trip.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,24th April 2011,unverified,Flew out of Heathrow to Sydney. Found Terminal 3 to be really good - we arrived very late - only 10 minutes before our check-in closed and still managed to get through all the security procedures before the boarding commenced. The concourse outside terminal 3 is especially attractive and inviting and has been well thought out.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,A Patel,United Kingdom,4th April 2011,unverified,Terminal 4 and 5 having been newly refurbished are extremely nice wide open spaces very short and quick queues and a nice overall experience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Ian Arnold,United Kingdom,3rd April 2011,unverified,Terminal 3. Check in was OK and getting through security was relatively fast - about 15 minutes considering the amount of people (1100 in the morning) trying to get through. Good range of shops once into departures and reasonable prices. On our return at 2120 getting through passport control diabolical. 2 desks open for UK/EU passport holders and took 45 minutes to get through even with 8 desks open eventually. Expect a long walk from the aircraft to get to this area anyway.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,K Ward,United Kingdom,25th March 2011,unverified,Terminal 4 - this terminal is a little isolated compared to the rest of Heathrow - and getting a hotel room close by overnight before our flight was difficult. But T4 itself was pleasant clean and efficient. We had no delay and the flight got away on-time. Security queues were substantial but staff were processing fast - so we queued for about 10-15mins not to bad! On return baggage reclaim for slow to start we waited at for about 10-15mins for the bags to appear.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,21st March 2011,unverified,T5 is a class act - well designed and very customer friendly. I travelled with hand baggage only and the security assistant was very good at sorting out my toleteries and even packed the bag for me!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,G Senior,United Kingdom,21st March 2011,unverified,Terminal 5 swift BA checkin and dismally slow and disorganised BAA security check even in a priority line. When will BAA sort this out? T5B lounge was fine. Coming back aircraft landed at T5C so bus to T5 main. Most bags waiting when I got through security but my skis were not. Even so on the tube within an hour of touch down.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,A Hijmans,Brazil,16th March 2011,unverified,T1 on my way to Ireland. Travellers to UK and Ireland destinations beware: once you go through security food and drink options become very scarce indeed.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Alan Wan,United Kingdom,10th March 2011,unverified,Departed from T1 check in was in zone K there is a dedicated security area which is very handy took no time to get through. T1 seems spacious and quiet compared to T3 and I prefer its eating choices than the latter.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,T Neyrinck,Belgium,2nd February 2011,unverified,"As long as you stay in T5 LHR is okay. I transit throgh T5 many times a year to and from BRU to and from the US Asia the Middle-East BA lounges are roomy well catered and the terminal is very airy and well lit. Only drawdowns are the fact that you cannot access the lounges from check-in level : must go down first than back up again and much room for improvement as for the timing of the gate announcements especially when your flight is leaving from a ""satellite""."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,R Oussalah,Italy,19th January 2011,unverified,The newly refitted Heathrow T4 is an amazing transformation from the dreadful old one. As a SkyTeam Elite plus member check in was timely and pleasant space is improved the shops and food selections are varied and SkyTeam lounge is the much better than the ones you see in other airports. Security is still a nightmare though despite improvements in the queuing methods and on arrival the luggage area hasn't been refurbished so it still looks nasty. Queuing on arrival if you are not lucky (meaning arriving at the same time as a couple other flights) you might be in there for over an hour. Overall great new departure side need loads of work on the arrivals one.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,Julie Michaud,United Kingdom,11th January 2011,unverified,Disgusting service weekend of 18th/19th December. Very badly organised both for the weather conditions (despite boasting how well prepared they were!) and how they took care of their customers in the subsequent confusion. BAA staff should be ashamed of themselves both as a corporate and as individuals.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Alexander Gan,Singapore,4th January 2011,unverified,Terminal 3 and Terminal 5 in December 2010. Transiting was fair from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. T5 was huge facilities not that well and building layout horrible. Return flight through Terminal 3 waiting time was fair due to snow. Facilities not as good. Very clean though.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,C Hamze,Canada,17th November 2010,unverified,Great airport! Had a great time passing a four hour layover in Terminal 1 and then again Terminal 3 on the way back. (As happy as we could be considering a death in the family) everything was very efficient very clean and actually pretty reasonably priced! The only thing I would suggest is that at security if you are a woman and you 'beep' through the metal scanner and they have a female officer pat you down I would suggest that there be a little area aside where the women can be checked. They do this in other airports and I find that it's much more comfortable. Just a little curtained area just right there would do. Something to think about.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,John Oram,United Kingdom,10th November 2010,unverified,It was hard to fault Terminal 5 on this arrival. From plane to transit to arrival hall was completely painless. IRIS worked as advertised and there were no immigration lines anyway. Baggage arrived almost immediately. A two minute walk to the short term car park reunited us with our car which had been driven for only 2 miles in our absence. T5 has settled in well.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Graham,United Kingdom,8th November 2010,unverified,Over the past couple of months I've had to use Heathrow a number of times - used to hate Heathrow but what a joy Terminal 5 is. Hardly any queuing lots of open space and great views of the runways.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,John Oram,United Kingdom,8th November 2010,unverified,There was little to say about Heathrow on our latest departure to Los Angeles. The valet parking staff were charmless and weary. BAA do themselves no favours by taking many details on booking which they do not pass on in the form of complete documentation for ones arrival. Thus information which has already been given has to be repeated. Security was a little more pleasant than usual. They know in their hearts that the end is coming for some of the more ridiculous processes. Queues were not long.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Bill Atkins,United States,8th November 2010,unverified,Last trip through T5 was better than previous visits but below what should be expected from a brand new facility. Had to wait for steps then repeated standing in line for people to look at boarding passes then for passport control. This time security was better and Fast Track was fast for the first time. The whole thing looks cobbled together and is not a good example of British organization.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,4th November 2010,unverified,Flew from LHR Terminal 3 late October on flight to Madrid. Checked in within 5 minutes of arriving and went straight through to the well equipped airside with plenty of good shops and eateries to entertain. Security queues minimal and staff were generally friendly too.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Campbell,United Kingdom,20th October 2010,unverified,I travelled through Terminal 5 on a BA domestic flight in the early morning and experienced greatly improved standards. The security process is quick and previous rudeness of the staff seems to have gone. There are excellent shopping facilities and no bussing to the gates which was often the case at TN1. On the way back the flight arrived before time and the bags were available in 10 minutes. No complaints at all.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,S Thorogood,United Kingdom,12th October 2010,unverified,Having checked-in online the day before our flight to Vienna it was a simple painless task to go to the bag drop then through immigration and security. Considering it was peak time on a Thursday morning we would have expected the pre-boarding processes to have been a lot slower. Security and immigration fully staffed by pleasant people. Good options airside at Terminal One for food and shopping. The return ten days later was equally slick. Long walk from the gate to baggage reclaim but Immigration took a matter of seconds and we were on our way within 40 minutes of landing.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,B Smith,Spain,10th October 2010,unverified,"Arrived from MAD on BA at terminal 3 last month. Bus transfer not a pleasant experience but at least as a BA branded operation they seem to try to keep it efficient. Bit of a trek around a typically maze-like run of Heathrow stairs slopes and corridors to get to passport control where I was confronted with thousands people waiting in long lines at a dozen or more desks - and thankfully two lonely desks completely deserted for EU arrivals. Through in 10 seconds! Luggage turned up fairly speedily too - although an ""arrival time"" estimate on the monitors would be a handy addition. Not too bad then but airbridges not buses for BA flights would be very welcome."
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Rob Payne,United Kingdom,22nd September 2010,unverified,Our first visit to Heathrow Terminal 5. Departed and arrived within 12 days this month. Departure no queues used fast bag drop no issues no queues at Security (about 9.30am on a Sunday) Used BA exec lounge good range of snacks and drinks available also free wi-fi. On our arrival back into Heathrow we had to disembark by stairs and into buses how sad that London is only place this seems to happen! Then went in Border Control and the room was absolutely packed (about 2045hrs on Thursday) having said that the queue we were in moved quite quickly and we soon got to our luggage retrieval area to find out suitcases some of the first out - we were out of the airport on our Hoppa bus 30 mins after landing so whilst not perfect we were pleased with that.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,P Hardy,United Kingdom,5th September 2010,unverified,Heathrow has had something of a major transformation over the past few years. 5 years ago you could expect long queues art check-in longer queues at security more long queues at immigration and extensive waits for your baggage - if it turned up at all. The terminals were drab and outdated - threadbare grey carpets cheap red plastic old fashioned information screens. In my experience this isn't the picture anymore. Check-in is mainly down to the airlines but certainly for BA the queuing has all but gone for United - not so much. Security never seems to take more than 5 to 10 minutes - same for immigration. As for baggage the last couple of times - it's beat me to the carousel and the time before that it was only a few minutes. The terminals themselves have been updated and Terminals 1 and 4 are now bright clean and airy. Terminal 3 is brighter but still feels a bit cramped. Terminal 5 which is new is excellent. I'm sure people still occasionally still have bad experiences and I've never changed flights there. But for me Heathrow is no longer somewhere I try to avoid.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Graham,United Kingdom,5th September 2010,unverified,I've never really needed to use Heathrow with Emirates flying from my local airport of Newcastle. From what I could remember Heathrow was always a bit of a nightmare very dull no real light - but I have to say T5 is fantastic plenty of space - nice toilets hardly any queuing great views of the runways. All round a pleasure.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Adam Farrell,United Kingdom,1st September 2010,unverified,Terminal 5 to Manchester on a Saturday afternoon. No queue at boarding pass check and security quite friendly even when camera couldn't take my picture for the domestic security procedures. After a few minutes a less helpful colleague took the photo and I passed into security area - 15 mins in the queue but gate was close by and seated onboard with doors closed before departure time.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Tony McLaughlin,United States,26th August 2010,unverified,Second time through T5 this time for a European flight and it is still a breeze. Had breakfast at Plane Food expensive but excellent. Departed from A gates plenty of room. On return bags on carousel as usual.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Charles Pratt,United States,18th August 2010,unverified,Taking a group thru terminal 4 today. It was so easy. It is so nice to be able to find your way around with all the signage. I found this building to be clean neat and easy to get around with a large group of travelers. Can't wait for all skyteam members to be moved to this terminal. Checking in was very fast. Employees where friendly and very helpful.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,1,David Gordon,United Kingdom,15th August 2010,unverified,Arrival at T4. Flight landed 20.25. A long wait (nearly 30 minutes) to cross the runway to reach the stand at T4. On stand at 21.00 - but baggage not on the carousel until 22.15. A dismal performance.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,S Smith,United Kingdom,12th August 2010,unverified,Used both T3 and T5. Flight connections worked as it should and I was pleasantly surprised thinking it would be harder than it was. T3 I don't particularly like with it's lack of daylight however it can't be helped. Gate area was freezing cold which was disappointing. T5 I really like apart from the flight connections area. Being shouted at by staff who obviously don't like working there herding you up the escalator to security. When you reach the top of the escalator it is crowded and you have to force your way off the escalator. This area is really badly designed and lets the terminal down. Plenty to keep you occupied even on a long connections like mine of 5 hours. Impressed with T5 so-so about T3.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Adrian Jenkins,New Zealand,10th August 2010,unverified,Terminal 3 arrivals pretty awful Departures pretty good. Everything about the arrivals level looked old immigration hall is a mess. The queue was quite long for non UK/EU citizens - more empty desks than occupied ones arrivals hall wasn't much better. Departing from Terminal 3 was a pleasant experience. SIA uses check-in area A which is much more open than other check-in areas. Departures lounge had a good range of shops and cafes perfectly pleasant waiting here - a great improvement on the last time I had been through T3 ten years ago.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Michael Matthews,Canada,24th July 2010,unverified,Have used T3 for four decades during which improvements have generally not made things better. The Duty Free area is way too large and the prices not at all that competitive: area should be halved for more comfort and seating places. Distances to the gates are unacceptable. A miserable places for arrivals; departures is much better but still not good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,J Jensen,United States,13th July 2010,unverified,I have travelled through several terminals 1/3/4 and find them all very different. Terminal 4 is out of the way south side of the runways but is modern and clean. Not a lot of restaurants inside a lot of shopping for that last minute duty free item however. Terminal 1 is old but once terminal 2 is redone it is expected to be replaced. Overall it is crowded but seems to be well taken care of. Terminal 3 is huge - if you have a flight from one of the ends of the long concourses take comfortable shoes! I think most North American and Asian carriers are based in terminal three so mornings are busy read maps to not get lost which is easy to do in this terminal. London Heathrow is a great airport a lot of things to buy or if you like plane watching all terminals offer a view of airlines from all around the World. It feels a lot closer to London than Gatwick but it can be a bit more expensive to get into Central London from Heathrow.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Paul Harvey,United Kingdom,29th June 2010,unverified,Terminal 1 international arrival midday on a Sunday. Bussing to the terminal was prompt although there was a long walk to immigration. Queues long for both EU and other passport holders but he EU side moved quite fast. Between Immigration and Baggage there was only one small toilet which led to queues outside. Baggage worked well and the total time between the wheels touching the ground and leaving the airport with two bags was 1 hour.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,N Haynes,United Kingdom,28th June 2010,unverified,Terminal 5. I was amazed how good this terminal was (first time user). We had an early flight and ate breakfast at the Gordon Ramsey Plane Food restaurant. Excellent food and service plus it was peaceful compared to the rest of the terminal eateries. We used the bag drop service excellent and rapid service. Departure lounge good adequate seating and excellent range of shops. Good seating at gates. On return flight very smooth walk through UK entry checks and our bags came rapidly to carousel. Signs to T5 long stay car park (and other transportation) very good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,John Wilson,United Kingdom,25th June 2010,unverified,Terminal 5. Maybe we were lucky due to flying out during the BA strike but there were no queues anywhere and the place was spotless. Decent choice of shops and eateries. So nice and light compared to the other enclosed stuffy terminals. On the way back we were disembarked at terminal B so had to get the shuttle train to the main terminal. We were out within 30 minutes of landing.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Tung,United Kingdom,23rd June 2010,unverified,Departed from T3 early morning (Air Canada) and arrived back early morning. I frequently use T1 and T5 and have very positive opinions on the arrival experience - generally very fast and smooth with the exception of T5 when BA flights can't find a gate to park. T3 has improved significantly. The building is still very old and the departure hall is still like a third world airport. However it is not as crowded as it used to be not a long queue in front of security. Some annoying passengers questioned why they had to take off their accessories water etc but you encounter those kind of passengers everywhere in the world. After security there are plenty of shopping. Heathrow is probably the best place for airport shopping partly due to the exchange rate. Arrival was a good experience. Its a long walk as usual but for EU/UK passport holder or those using Iris scan there was no queue at all. You whip through immigration in a second. Then the luggage came out before I even arrived at the belt.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,Luke Williamson,Switzerland,23rd June 2010,unverified,T5 - Horrific transfer took 1h15 to get from the aircraft and through security impatient staff chaos at the top of the escalator and security staff unsure of where Geneva was. However domestic transfer did not involve passport or security checks so no issues.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Daniel Katz,Denmark,17th June 2010,unverified,There is a huge difference according to which terminal you use. We used T3 and T4. T3 is very boring looks like it was built in the 1970's and not well maintained whereas T4 was a fine experience with good shopping possibilities. I wonder why there are no carts available airside - it is not good for shopping or the passengers which carries handbaggage.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,C O'Neill,United Kingdom,24th May 2010,unverified,I have come through Heathrow a few times now for domestic flights between London and Belfast. I've had no problem or mishaps and found the airport as I would wish to. Although the walking distance is quite long the routes are always well signposted and it is easy to get to where I need to be. If you have any mobility issues then assistance might well be advised to help you cover the potentially large distances involved with getting around such a huge airport. The shops and cafes that are available are also very good (although a little pricey).
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,M Preston,South Africa,23rd May 2010,unverified,Much as I dislike BA and have avoided them for years I had no choice for a recent trip. T5 is almost enough reason to resume travelling with BA. It's light and airy no queues employees who clearly enjoy working in such a lovely environment and a quick and easy transition from arrival to departure. An example for others to follow. A pity that the cabin crew on the BA flight were surly and haughty which detracted from the initial good experience of T5. The ratings I have given refer to T5 not to Heathrow in general.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,N Francis,United Kingdom,23rd May 2010,unverified,T5 is generally a great experience. Slightly odd desk staffing policy at check-in and it can sometimes be an issue knowing where to go - BA staff on foot around desks are not very pro- active in moving people to empty desks. Anyway security has always been quick for me and staff courteous. Loads of shops/places to eat but still never feels crowded and noisy even at peak times. Tonnes of natural light. In all compared to previous offerings in T4 (or the dreaded T3) this is a real haven for Heathrow!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,A Makins,Canada,10th May 2010,unverified,Terminal 3 has had a face lift but it's superficial improvement. I don't like the design of T5 with gates in the waiting area. Outbound flight to Amsterdam on BA involved a bus trip to the plane surprising requirement given the money spent on building a new terminal. Return to LHR from AMS was nothing short of a joke. Arrived in heavy rain airbridge at assigned gate wouldn't work because of the weather. A few U-turns around Heathrow later arrive at another gate. Airbridge makes it 2 feet from the plane and gives up - reason: rain. Have to wait for stairs to arrive so we can have a nice wet walk to the terminal. Time from landing to deplaning about the same as the flight itself.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Rob Boyce,United Kingdom,7th May 2010,unverified,Flew out of T1 to Munich: speedy check in using the self service terminal and quickly and efficiently handled bag drop. The 'queue' at security was just two people so no delays whatsoever. It definitely seems to be a better experience at Heathrow these days!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Paul Bailey,United Kingdom,20th April 2010,unverified,Travelled out of T5 for the third time in 6 months. I use the Valet car park so from dropping off your car it's easy to be airside inside 10 mins. The terminal is light airy and no feeling of claustrophobia shopping and food options are good. Easy transit to the B and C gates.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Jonathan Kelly,United Kingdom,14th April 2010,unverified,Flew T4 to Houston and back. Last previous use of T4 was in March 2008 and the overall experience is much improved. Arrival at the terminal and check-in is now far superior although this has resulted in airside looking somewhat grubby in comparison especially at the gates. Arrivals was very busy with almost no space in which to queue for immigration. Overall a big improvement.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,12th April 2010,unverified,T1 is great now for passengers. I flew to DUB on BMI and the flight left from Gate 84 - this is 20 minutes from clearing security and where Aer Lingus operate their flights. Something to note because of the layout if passengers are disembarking doors are shut so you cannot get through - be careful if you are in need of the loo!
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,Peter Hutchinson,Australia,12th April 2010,unverified,In and out using T3 . Inbound transit was quick but surely the crowd controllers for non EU passport holders should be able to speak more languages. Outbound the waiting lounge was a disappointment. Having used T5 on a previous visit to UK the overall impression of T3 was not good.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Gary Farrelly,Ireland,18th March 2010,unverified,Heathrow is a very impressive operation. The part I was in was a bit jaded and grubby and chaotic. But all in all my LHR experience was very positive. Loads of places to eat and shop. Some decent views of the apron from the boarding gates. What I like most about Heathrow is the sheer quantity off carriers operating on all manner of routes from that airport. It really is a world class hub. And I am sure that if I has been travelling through the new T5 - I would have found the upkeep of the facilities that more bit clean and aesthetic.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,Alan Wan,United Kingdom,18th March 2010,unverified,Used T5 for the first time a much better experience than T3. There is plenty of natural light the toilets are clean and there are great views of the runways. The seating could be better lots of bench seats akin to T3 but there was some comfortable seats and lie down sofas by gates A7.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,3,K Chelvanathan,Malaysia,18th March 2010,unverified,Flew in and out of both Terminal 3 and 5 respectively and found Terminal 3 to be the same as it was two years back. Immigration queues for the non-EU passports were amazingly long and I wonder why the BAA authorities cannot work something out and make the terminal more user friendly and immigration friendly ? Terminal 5 on the other hand was a breeze and the modern architecture gave it a nice feeling. The Self Check In Kiosk is such a brilliant idea and saves a lot of time and hassle.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,J Tydeman,United Kingdom,3rd March 2010,unverified,Used Terminal 4 to fly to and from Nairobi. It has improved a lot since the recent terminal changes and although busy it felt less crowded and claustrophobic than before. There were very few queues of any great length which helped make it less stressful too. Credit where it is due - this airport is improving.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,4,David Howe,Canada,27th February 2010,unverified,Return trip from DUB to DEL transferring at Terminal One for Terminal Four. We found the transfer process relatively flawless even though our bags were not checked through. We took the elevator down to the train and found it quick and comfortable compared to many airports. This is a great improvement on previous connections made at LHR. Terminal Four lacks facilities airside not many eateries to choose from. Terminal One seemed better but the walk to the aircraft is way too long.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,2,P Littlefair,United Kingdom,26th February 2010,unverified,Terminal 3 quick check-in with Virgin Atlantic 2½ hours before departure. We were requested to go straight to airside then proceed to gate 2 hours before departure in order to allow for Gate security. However we were turned away from primary security being told passengers not allowed through until 2 hours before departure. Once allowed into security the queue was moderate. No gate listed until 1 hour before departure so had to endure the crowded shopping mall for an hour. BAA policy on using most of the space for shopping really does make using LHR terminals a depressingly uncomfortable experience.
London Heathrow Airport customer review,5,Tony McLaughlin,United Kingdom,22nd February 2010,unverified,First time using T5 - excellent. BA land agent was able to tell me all about the terminal and where to go when I got airside. BAA had staff on hand airside to assist travellers. Departed from B gates to USA. Security at gate was thorough but good humoured. Had to get a bus to the plane - so what. Bags waiting at carousel on return. Excellent first experience.
