"""horrible experience while transiting""",1,D Kalinova,"

D Kalinova (Czech Republic) 20th February 2022",20th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience while transiting. Arrived on time (actually a little earlier), bridge to the plane was broken and the airline staff took over an hour to find us stairs/get us out of the plane. The nearest restroom after exiting the plane was 10 minutes walk. Had to take a bus to another terminal and on arrival, I had to go through security. The lady at the security check was absolutely horrible and made me take out all liquids from my carry on from plastic transparent Ikea bags to move the containers with liquids to transparent bags available at the airport. She said that she will throw my liquids away if I don't do that. "
"""Poor Taxi pickup organisation""",2,Stephen Bennett,"

Stephen Bennett (United Kingdom) 20th February 2022",20th February 2022,"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor Taxi pickup organisation at Terminal 3 Heathrow’s new approach to divert taxis to level 3 of the car park to pick up arriving passengers is causing long queues, congestion and frustration for arriving passengers. All passengers are required to navigate 2 different elevators with children and luggage. I waited with my family with at least 150 other people waiting for lifts to get to our arriving taxi. When getting to the pick up point there was further delays due to the congestion of around 20 taxis trying to find their passengers. More can be done to ensure a more efficient operation at the easily accessible forecourt."

British Airways in future at Gatwick until Virgin have a change of heart. "

Adriana Oikonomou (United Kingdom) 16th January 2022",16th January 2022,"Not Verified |  I very rarely post reviews, however, I was looking for reviews about T5, to verify if others had problems with the 'Drop Off Zone' at T5 like I did. I had the same problem as reviewed below by Adrian Sharpe, I was looking for the multi-storey car park, and by mistake I entered in the Drop Off Zone. I did not stay, I immediately left the Drop Off Zone, and I found my way to the multi-storey car park. I parked and paid for my parking. To my absolute dismay I received a penalty charge this week, charging me £40 to have entered the Drop Off Zone. I am appealing this."
"""had to pay a extra charge of £40""",1,Adrian Sharpe,"

Adrian Sharpe (United Kingdom) 14th January 2022",14th January 2022,"✅ Trip Verified | The car parking company, Apcoa, is, in my opinion, operating a corrupt practice. I wanted to pick my wife and children up (having parked nearby). The signs are utterly inadequate and don't tell you what you are doing. I asked a policeman in the end because there were no staff. You are funnelled towards the drop off zone. The short stay car park is signposted off to the right but almost unnoticeable. When you go in the drop off zone you are on APNR cameras and liable to pay. There is nothing obvious indicating this (I physically got out and looked). 19 days later I got a PCN. I pointed out that I was in a drop off zone, was supposed to be elsewhere (the policeman told me this) and had then gone to the short stay car park as directed. They weren't interested and fined me. An hour and a half held hostage by parking, paid £5.30 and then had to pay a extra charge of £40. Add to that that entry to the UK was standing in a congested line for an hour with all and sundry. "

Brittainy Hilsman (United States) 9th January 2022",9th January 2022,"Not Verified |  The worst experience! Upon touchdown we had to wait on the tarmac for about 10 minutes while the plane parked ahead of us tried to figure out what he was supposed to be doing. While transit through the airport and customs was a breeze (this was a first, usually takes over an hour), we waited for over half an hour for our luggage to start coming through on the belt. Meanwhile, we witnessed 20+ airport workers just hanging around joking and laughing like there weren’t hundreds of people across 4 flights waiting for their luggage to come through one conveyor. Nobody seems to care about customer service and everyone employee we encountered was rude and couldn’t be bothered to answer simple questions. By far the worst airport experience in my 30+ years of traveling. This airport should be ashamed!"

W Carter (United States) 27th December 2021",27th December 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | While not entirely painless, I had a pleasant and mostly easy experience. I arrived in the UK from the US, traveling internationally for the first time and was given helpful information from both staff and repeat travelers at Heathrow. Customs was very quick and straightforward, taking less than 20 minutes. I arrived and was picked up from the airport all in under 1 hour which is rather impressive for traveling internationally. Great WiFi connection, ample restrooms and seating and before customs all signage was easy to follow. Signage post customs and by the car park/pick up area was quite hard to follow, but I will possibly lend some of that to being American. I was frustrated by the amount of conveyers out of service, especially for disabled or elderly travelers. Lifts were also a bit tricky to find, especially for the demographics who need them most. Other than that, accessibility is great with many wheelchairs, trollies and services for travelers in need. Just be sure to take your time with navigating the pick up area."

Only 4-5 emigration officers were checking documents, air climatization is bad, people are getting tired, leaving the line for the WC visits and we are still not moving, 1 hour, 2 hours… you start looking at the other part where it’s dedicated to EU citizens. Why don’t you divert part of passengers there? Finally after 2½ hours they started to take families and give them priorities. It took me 3h15 min and I completed passport check in 30 seconds, officer never asked any questions just checked my Ukrainian passport and let me though. This is a pure disgrace."

I had many bags, and one of the attendants was very helpful during the train transfer by getting a trolley for me once I got off the train. The check-in procedure was very quick and smooth. The attendant was extremely helpful and polite, and explained everything thoroughly and made sure I had everything I needed to have for my arrival at my destination. Afterwards I went back to T5 to get a document signed. I had asked about it before and was told it could be signed if I came back after receiving my test result. I was a bit annoyed when I returned and they refused to sign the document. When I was going through security the staff was rude to me. I had started preparing my stuff in the line and was ready to finish unpacking my stuff once I could put my bag down. He kept repeating his instructions and did not give me a chance to finish before he repeated it again. I got very frustrated with him, which resulted in him being extremely patronizing. "

T Richards (United States) 19th February 2021",19th February 2021,"✅ Trip Verified | Even though we are in the middle of a pandemic, I did not see any real changes to when I last visited Heathrow Airport last year in January. There was no enforcement of any of the covid guidelines set in the UK, or when there were some attempts at social distances they made no sense and were extremely redundant. When exiting the plane after waiting for the majority of the passengers to leave, I was approached by a very rude and hostile security guard. As I was travelling alone he made sure to speak with me rather than the family with two children (with no masks) walking behind me. I have taken the covid precautions seriously therefore I was wearing PPE (white disposable overalls, n95 mask, and face shield). The guard, sarcastically mocked if I were travelling to paint and then began berating me about how it is my fault that there is still a pandemic going on. Considering that there are far more people who flaunt their ignorance of the guidelines it is baffling why he was being like this about it whereas the family behind me was let off. Ridiculous. The border control guard, however, was the complete opposite. He asked about my reason of visit which I promptly gave as well as telling him all the precautions I have taken and he was very polite and understanding and let me through with not an ounce of attitude."

Imtiaz Quwailid (United Kingdom) 18th October 2020",18th October 2020,"✅ Trip Verified | First overseas trip of 2020 and surprisingly it was a very straightforward process through Heathrow Terminal 2. We arrived with 3 hours before departure but needn’t have worried. Travelling to Warsaw on LO282, our check in was completed online 24 hrs before. The check in area was quiet and we walked straight up to the kiosk to print our luggage tags. After issuing the tags, the kiosk printed paper boarding passes without any prompt - trying to save paper, we had already got our passes on our mobile phones. Would advise airlines to check if passengers need a paper pass at the kiosk. Once our luggage was tagged, we walked straight over to a drop off desk. In the past, there would be a queue, but given our early arrival at the airport, and the drop in passenger numbers this year, queueing wasn’t required. Tags scanned and luggage on its way, we joined the queue through security. Only two lanes were open, but the staff were extremely quick in moving passengers through. Before we knew it we were airside. From walking into the terminal to getting through security only took 20 mins. Obviously the main difference this year is the number of travellers going through Heathrow (or any airport for that matter). Airside was much quieter than we have seen, and one can only imagine the loss in revenue for the high end shops that cater to the wealthy passengers. We made do with visiting World Duty Free, then WHSmiths (always need some reading material) followed by a pint at the pub on the upper level. Naturally everyone is wearing masks and observing social distancing. My wife was disappointed that the perfume samples were not available - for me this was a major plus as I would usually have to wait ages for her to try different scents before choosing which to buy. Our flight usually departed from a B gate, but given the low number of flights, we were directed to one of the gates at the main lounge. Arriving back to Terminal 2 a week later was a little bit busier than before. To start off with as we deplaned, we had to show our COVID documentation (completed online 2 days before). Several fellow passengers had not done this so had to stand to one side and do it there and then. Our arrival coincided with a couple of long hauls from the Far East so there was a long queue at passport control. This wasn’t helped by only three e-gates being used. Just as I got to the front of the queue, they closed the e-gate! However, a member of staff was very good at getting three lanes down through the 2 remaining e-gates. I wonder how these queues will change once we end the transition period at the end of the year. By the time we got through passport control and walked over to the carousel, the luggage was just being brought out. From exiting the aircraft to leaving the terminal took 50 mins."

Of course we had to pass security again, even though it was transit and the same terminal. So anything you might have bought back in New York was good to throw out. Luckily for us it was just some bottles of water. But at security, I had a can of Powder spray for the shoes/feet. The can was clearly Powder, measured in grams and was on an outside net pocket of my backpack. The security staff, instead of just taking care of the can, they got everything out of my backpack, every single individual thing, including cosmetics that were actually in the bag on the tray, and put them directly on the incredibly filthy tray (exactly what I tried to avoid touching with my stuff). This was done at a very slow pace. Also my dad had issues with all his bags, instead of going directly to the problem, the staff touched and got everything out of the bag. Hopefully I never have to use this airport ever again, will avoid as much as possible."

"""experience absolutely awful""",2,Harriet Mak,"

Harriet Mak (United Kingdom) 3rd December 2019",3rd December 2019,"Not Verified | Had just come off a 12-hour flight from Hong Kong and had to connect to get a domestic flight. We arrived at Terminal 5 but we were at the C Gates, so we were required to travel to the main terminal by train. It was around 5 in the morning and at least 2 flights had landed with a large number of passengers. There was only one train available that needed to take people back to the main terminals before returning to the C Gates and back and forth, so this took longer than expected. We were then required to go through security again however there were no signs or guides advising that we needed to do this. In some other international airports that we have connected, there is no need to go through security checks again. Because we only had 2 hours to connect, we decided we would try and head straight over to our gate before going to the toilets etc., but we encountered security instead. The queues were all over the place and you could see everyone was a bit fed up at this point. I had just come off the plane with at least 500ml of water left as well and instead of being helpful, I was shouted at for having a large bottle of water and was told to empty it on the spot by drinking it all (seriously?) or the security guard would bin my water bottle (was desperate for the toilet as well at this point). When we told her that nobody informed us that there would be security checks again, she shrugged and told us we should've emptied it in the toilets - obviously, I would've done that if I knew we had to go through this again! Overall she was incredibly rude, treated us as if we were stupid, put the blame on us and made our experience absolutely awful. If I had gotten her name I would've made a formal complaint.

G Ralph (Finland) 8th November 2019",8th November 2019,"Not Verified | Security staff hate their job. We're a family of 4 with 2 small kids and connecting to Miami at Heathrow terminal 3. First we have to go through the security check in Helsinki and get rid of all our drinks, buy water, drinks and even a bottle of liquor at Helsinki. Arriving after a 2.5hr flight at Heathrow, with 90 minutes to change flights. First you need to go through exact the same security check as in Helsinki. Security staff yelling and threatening people to listen to them or else they will be delayed. Here you are as a parent trying to get your family to another plane for a nice and stress free vacation. Unfortunately I forgot to take 2 iPads out of my bag. A simple mistake. The security staff took my bag (and several other bags of “criminals”, including an old English lady who clearly had difficulties understanding the instructions) to put it aside for at least 15 minutes before eving looking at it. The bag and iPads now needed some special investigation and it took another 15 minutes before I had my bag back. While I was waiting I could see several other people in the same situation, staff not trying at all to help the travelers, staff yelling and cursing at people for not putting the trays at the correct place. We had to run from the security check to the gate, me carrying a crying 3 year old, and a 7 year old trying to keep up. What a relief to make it to the gate and meet the incredible nice and friendly staff of British Airways. I feel bad for them, but I will never fly again via Heathrow. We had plenty of alternatives to fly to Miami, but thought Heathrow was a world class airport. Oh and the glass bottle of liquor I bought at Helsinki airport tax free and had with me in the flight to Miami. Not a single word to get that through security."

J Tung (United Kingdom) 23rd October 2019",23rd October 2019,Not Verified |  Departed from LHR T2 to Bangkok in October (evening). The check in for premium passengers was hassle free and security check was super efficient. In fact I've never encountered long security checks in any of the Heathrow terminals. It's one of the most efficient security I've been through. Once passed security there were plenty of shops or sitting areas with charging facilities. The terminal was clean and airy. On arrival we were connected to jet bridge in no time and was out of the plane very quick. Early evening on a Sunday with multiple wide bodied planes landing resulted in longer immigration queue. However the queue kept moving fast and most of the e gates were in operation. From landing to clearing immigration it took me less than 25 minutes despite the busy landing time. The only disadvantage or slightly negative experience on T2 is the long walk between the main building A and the satellite gates B (where most long haul flights depart/arrive). You have to go down and up on long escalators.

H Simpson (United Kingdom) 18th October 2019",18th October 2019,✅ Trip Verified | Traveled in and out of Heathrow four times this year. Most recently on Terminal 5. It's a good airport. I don't understand the complaints about this. The security queues are quick and painless and the self service bio metric check on arrival with the machines work well and I'm out of the terminal into the underground within 10 minutes of landing. The toilets are well maintained and the prices of food and drinks with the variety means there is choice for all price points. The negative is lack of seating throughout the terminal as nearly all the space is taken up by retail shops.
"""immigration queues extremely long""",1,W Lee,"

W Lee (United Kingdom) 17th October 2019",17th October 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst airport for two reasons. Firstly, the security staff I encountered are very rude and unhelpful. When they try to check your bags, they do it at an incredibly slow pace that's literately maddening for anyone trying to catch a flight. Secondly the immigration queues are extremely long and counters are poorly staffed, normally people have to wait for an hour or so to go through immigration which is unbelievable. One time for a complete 15 minutes interval there was not a single staff member serving at the counters, not a single one! "

For the second time now, the last time was about 5 years ago and I swore that would be the last time I went through Heathrow, but security seemed to find yet again a way to cause me to be within minutes of missing my next flight. Both times my items breezed through the scanner, but ""I"", who had no metal objects on or in me, had to be scanned twice, and held to a very aggressive body pat-down. They even used two hand held metal scanners to search me and couldn't find a thing. I'm wearing a cotton shit, jeans and socks, no shoes. It took them well over 15 minutes to perform this abuse of power, and for a reason, I have no idea of. These people are truly messed up, I despise them and hope never again to have to go to that horrible airport again."

The main thing is it realises it is an airport with shopping not the other way round. Inbound the connections from Domestic to an International can be made in 20 minutes - I have to do it at least twice on Sunday evenings as my flight has been delayed. The signs are clear, the 5A to 5B or 5C shuttle is effcient and never seems crowded. I have access to BA First class or Concorde lounges but have tried other lounges and bars and they all seem good (one in T5 beside the domestic gate lounge is very good at serving rapidly). There are loads of snack type outlets but it doesn't stink of food everywhere. On arrival the e-passport gates and security works very efficiently and I am not sure fast track actually delivers very much. Shopping is very good and I can't fault the terminal cleanliness. Two issues stop it getting a 10/10 - firstly if you are on a remote stand it is a very long bus ride and the buses are not very good, and secondly the have too many slots so if you are on alate out say 21.00-13.00 then you are going to spend a lot of time at the gate or in a queue."

British wit and world famous repute for good education and common sense is no where evident as we queue in dingy surroundings, eye sight gradually deteriorating due to faulty blinking fluorescent lighting, somehow no money forthcoming from the coffers of the wealthy British Empire for a replacement tube. Rows and rows of happy holiday makers after enjoying gentle British hospitality, cursing the somewhat hostile system of tax refund, obviously aimed at discouraging visitors from claiming what is rightfully theirs, in a cunning, sneaky, unfriendly, money-faced manner. Having travelled extensively, contributing to the healthy economies of a large number of countries, I can safely say this tax refund system and premise to be the absolute worst, even surpassing Paris’s CDG many times over. Common sense dictates more counters required for expeditious service, better ventilation (!) in a bigger area, toilet facilities, seating areas for the elderly and those with children and properly functioning lights (basic requirement!). This system of screwing visitors is keeping the economy afloat in a most underhanded manner. How disappointing that we leave Bonny ol England with this impression and what a put-off!"

First of all, very clean airport. Terminal 2 is always spick and span and presentable. Signs are very helpful, want to go to the tube? Arrivals, then underground. Don't know the terminal you're going to? Check their website and find your airline's terminal. Queuing times are efficient as they take into account the intense amount of passengers that go through the airport, just not the planes, you'll be waiting 10, maybe 20 minutes waiting to take off, possibly missing a connecting flight. Seating wise, the seats are quite good to rest on for a person who lives quite far from airports. The food is fatty but really tasty. I expected so much less from an airport like this. The staff are genuinely lovely. Especially some of the staff at the UK border that are pleasant to speak to. Overall, a very good airport to fly in if you're not on a time crunch."

I have not been out of the United States since 2008, on a cruise in the Caribbean. I would be stunned if anyone could find a terrorist of my description but the screener acted as if I were carrying a grenade. I realize that your screeners may not be the brightest of people but there is no excuse for their hostility and complete lack of common sense. There is no other word than, ""Bully."" If the screeners keep up at this, someone is going to sue them for battery. We have relief in common.

Self Check in is now the norm. At 05.30 on a Friday morning, it wasn't that busy. Terminal signage indicated that South was less busy than North for getting through security, and indeed it was and it delivers you right outside the Gordon Ramsay restaurant, which is excellent! Flight left from C57, which must be one of the furthest gates from the main terminal. It is also a long walk to the plane from there. Arriving - E-Gates are now the norm for immigration. It was quite busy, and I fear that if there is a Hard Brexit, it will be very chaotic at the UK Border. Bags from my flight started to arrive on the belt as I arrived in the Baggage Hall.

After an hour of claiming our bags I found 1 trolley and some how managed to came out. When we came out I can’t believe it but there was so many trolley outside - airport staff was just going around but not bother to bring the trolley inside the airport. Very disappointed. I think they not bother about service.

You will miss your flight or be running to the terminal while having a panic attack at the 100 thoughts going through your head on how to reschedule a missing flight. This is due to the extra security for liquids. I left my chapstick in my purse along with a prescription eye drop size of my pinky which warranted extra security! This is insanely ridiculous! Extra security took forever. My colleague wasn’t able to put all her toiletries in the small clear plastic bag they provide. The bag has to fully close and hers didn’t, thus extra security warranted for her. After going through the extra security, she had to dump the things that didn’t fit in this ridiculous small bag. We ended missing our flight. No other airport makes you go through this scrutinizing process of extra security that only causes delays and angry passengers. I’ll never fly through Heathrow again."

During immigration, US citizens were allowed to use the kiosks for UK citizens, which made the process quicker. While flying back to US on a Sunday, the check-in and security lines in T3 were long. After security, the terminal was crowded, but there were open seats available. The seating area doesn't provide any plane spotting opportunity. Terminal 3 has a shopping mall vibe, so the shopping and dining options are fantastic. In Heathrow, the boarding gate is displayed minutes before boarding starts.

On return around 22.45 the finger took a long time being deployed and then suitcases took ages to arrive. Big pause of around 15 minutes between first and second batch of bags coming through.

As a UK citizen entering from the US and transiting to Manchester, we arrived in T3 and had to wait about 10 minutes for an operator to attach the airbridge. Once attached, we had a lengthy walk (about 15 minutes) to get to the UK Border and immigration check. Signage was OK but limited. Having been scanned at the ePassport barrier, I thought I was through and into the terminal proper but I was immediately confronted with another bank of scanners and bar code readers - no explanation or instructions. There was an unhelpful and surly security guard who stopped me from walking around these scanners. He told me that I had to (again) remove my glasses and have my photo taken for ""airport security"" - why? I asked him when my data would be removed from Heathrow's system. He gave me the impression he had no idea why I was asking and then glibly agreed with me that it would be deleted when I left the airport. I dont believe it for a moment. Given the recent court case about facial recognition software, where is the policy statement from Heathrow about the usage of our data and how it is protected/deleted? Once through this barrier, another lengthy walk to a bus gate for a long transfer to T5. Why does Heathrow not have a skytrain connecting terminals? After our overnight flight, we were made to wait about 30 minutes until a bus arrived at which point, there was a massive queue of people. The driver of the bus was rude, just packing people into the bus and then driving at quite a speed around a maze of roads to get to T5. We were then confronted with another walk to security where we again went through the usual street theatre of security, overseen by an unsmiling security guard - welcome to the UK. Had I been a foreign visitor, I would not have had a good impression of the UK. Once through the chaos of security, the shopping mall which is T5 was crowded with very few seats available and throngs of confused looking people. Eventually, we got to our connecting gate where our pictures were taken again before we were allowed to board. This airport is horrendous. Having flown in from JFK, I suggest that LHR management take a look at how a proper airport should be run."

You just don't need this when you have many things already to carry. The number of the departure gate is not displayed until quite late. We found our plane by the registration and using an app. Seating at departure gate is limited and the boading of the flight was mixed up to say the least. Our return leg was even worse, Passport control was all but un manned there were a few advisors sending everyone to E passport gates and my 16 yo Autistic son was ushered off to another gate. I was allowed through but my son was rejected and told to go and stand in a queue in unaccompanied. I asked why and they said that he was under 18, my son should have been allowed to use E gates according to the heathrow website at the time.

Heathrow was our connecting flight both coming in and returning home. By far the worst airport experience my wife or I have experienced on 'every' level. We are AA Frequent Flyers with Global Security status as well. LHR had the single most unnecessarily invasive, rude, redundant and down right nightmarish security checks & processing of any airport (International or domestic) we've ever encountered. And this was merely for a 'connecting' flight both times wherein we never left the secure area! In fact upon our initial arrival we were so delayed waiting to land then gate docking that we nearly missed connecting flight and were rushed with ""expedited pass"" by airport personnel with small group others yet we were 'still' run through the most rude, confusing and inhuman security checks ever experienced 'just' to get to our connecting flight gate! Really? Barely made our connecting flight and had no time to even use restroom in between all this rush and harassment. Our second Heathrow experience (returning home) was if you can believe it very much worse! Words are not enough to detail that experience and it still literally gives me nightmares and anxiety. The airport security is staffed almost exclusively by employees who almost all seemed to 'profile' travelers and ""run them through the ringer"" in the most rude, abrasive, disrespectful and insulting manner. I have no bias against any person as long they do their job properly and with respect for themselves, others and the institution they represent. The airport itself is horribly inefficient beginning with the bus transfers from arrival to departure gate areas, continuing with confusing signage or especially instructions, and finalized by some of the worst airport staff we've ever encountered in all our years flying. Again this was 'both' times we had to go through Heathrow and experienced by others around us as well, not an isolated incident. Heathrow is a disgrace to air travel & travelers and the fullest example of everything that is wrong today with airports in general.

Missed flights, long lines, rude security officials, total incompetence are all at work here. Avoid at all costs. Especially do not attempt a connecting flight here. My family trip from the US to Barcelona was marred by a hellish experience here! Avoid!"

John Rolfe (United Kingdom) 20th March 2019",20th March 2019,✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time travelling through LHR T2 and I was very impressed. Check in (for EVA Air) was very quick. Security was very efficient and there was a very small wait time. Once airside there is a good choice of shops and restaurants and importantly plenty of seating available. Toilets were clean! Will be happy to use T2 again.
"""limited seating and limited amenities""",3,F Norris,"

F Norris (United States) 19th March 2019",19th March 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | I have not been at Heathrow for many years, and I had to use Terminal 3 for a departure to New York. Not traveling on business this time, I was an economy passenger and I experienced this in such status. Basically, Terminal 3 is just a vast, overpriced shopping mall, crammed with every high-end store imaginable, with limited seating and limited amenities that I could see, e.g., USB charging ports for cell phones. One has to sit in a crowded, central seating area where gates are not announced until around 40 minutes before the boarding time. Once a gate is announced, it can be a 15-20 minute trek to a gate, even with moving sidewalks. And beware, there are very few toilets! The signs for the toilets take you on a yellow brick road kind of odyssey which can encompass a 10 minute walk through a maze of stores, unless I missed something, there is only one near the entrance to the mall after exiting security. There are no toilets near or at the gates, which, as I said, can be very far from the main seating ""pen"" so to speak. Also, the security lines can be long. When the airport web site states ""arrive 3 hours before departure"" there is a very good reason for that. I travel quite a bit internationally, and this is the first airport review I have ever written. But, I feel compelled to do this to warn others. I was very disappointed."
"""poor planning, design, and management""",3,R Wickersham,"

R Wickersham (Germany) 19th March 2019",19th March 2019,"Not Verified |  Poorly designed. After a long bus ride from T3 to T5, it can take up to 30 minutes to get to your gate. The gate for my flight was assigned and posted on the board less than an hour before the thing took off! So fun not knowing just where I needed to be for my flight. Just poor planning, design, and management!"

Terminal 5 arrivals is very well organised and clean. I love passing through the fast passport control E-gates system. I didn’t wait a lot for my laggage to be delivered. The terminal is very well connected to the other terminals and London."
"""Avoid going here""",1,Taylor Miller,"

Taylor Miller (United States) 3rd March 2019",3rd March 2019,Not Verified | The absolute worst airport that I have ever been to. They made me throw away all of my face products because you can only carry on one plastic bag of things. It took 2 hours to get from our first flight to our connecting flight. Absolutely ridiculous. The staff was very rude and disrespectful to me when I had questions. Avoid going here if you can help it.
"""rude and inconsiderate""",3,N John ,"

N John  (United Kingdom) 2nd March 2019",2nd March 2019,Not Verified |  Airport security staff at terminal 3 are rude and inconsiderate. No customer service skills nor empathy. Unfriendly. Airport management needs to invest more in their staff to increase job satisfaction and maybe hire people who are a better fit in dealing with customers.
"""such dirty trays used""",6,L Nelson,"

L Nelson (Denmark) 27th February 2019",27th February 2019,✅ Trip Verified | Really unpleasant with such dirty trays used in Security. Further used for shoes as well as all other belongings that you would normally not expose to “door mat” environment. Does not match a modern western style airport experience.
"""One of the best airports""",10,Allan Foster,"

Allan Foster (United Kingdom) 25th February 2019",25th February 2019,"Not Verified |  One of the best airports. Great service, clean and a large variety of shops and restaurants. It would be nice to have aircraft spotting facilities. A third runway is definitely required. I would definitely recommend flying through London Heathrow Airport."
"""expect the worst""

H Martin (United Kingdom) 25th February 2019",25th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Terminal Two, 7pm on a Thursday evening. Quite possibly the worst airport check in experience ever. We are a family of four with a three year old and a one year old. Check in process is a shambles now with people queuing for four different flights down one lengthy maze of barriers. Only two assistants struggling to cope with the chaos. We were treated like animals, penned into a barrier tape maze for 90 minutes. My wife had to crawl under the barriers with a buggy to go and feed the younger child who was getting quite upset, again no airport staff to advise or assist. Fellow travellers gave up their turn in the queue for us as they could see the effect that this experience was having on the children. The terminal building is clean and well signed but under staffed. If you are going to depart from here, expect the worst and hope for the best."

Georgios Efkolidis (United Kingdom) 14th February 2019",14th February 2019,"Not Verified |  Amazing experience out of T5. Great fast track security, nice selection of shops and duty free. Never disappoints me. On the way back, a whiz through immigration. Compared to Gatwick or Amsterdam, miles ahead."
"""quite a good airport""",9,C Matthews,"

C Matthews (United Kingdom) 31st January 2019",31st January 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  As a frequent user living in London I have to say it's quite a good airport nowadays, but with proviso that for transfer travellers I think its pretty awful. Great shops, food options and  security and immigration work quite well. "

Oliver Andersin (Sweden) 24th January 2019",24th January 2019,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow is great airport, it's easy to find your gate and shopping/food. There is a some differences between the terminals and terminal 5 is the better one. It's the standard a hub terminal should have and BA should be happy to have the terminal since it's in my opinion the best terminal in the world. Terminal 3 is also nice and but not as nice as T5. There is less of assortment there compared to T5 of food and shopping. LHR is a easy airport to reach and check-in and baggage claim is fast. Security can take some time, but never more than 15-30min."
"""excellent signage throughout""",8,N Manson,"

N Manson (United States) 23rd January 2019",23rd January 2019,✅ Trip Verified | What's not to like about London Heathrow Terminal 5. We transited here on our way to Athens and again on our way home to Boston. On both occasions the terminal was brightly lit with excellent signage throughout. There are excellent shopping and dining options. The area in the main building to take the trains to the satellite terminals can be crowded resulting in scarce seating. That's understandable given the number of passengers that go through this terminal. WiFi is free (sign up) and its excellent.

Wolfgang Bernhart (Germany) 21st January 2019",21st January 2019,✅ Trip Verified | Try to avoid! If you need to change terminals you rely on the trains but those are unreliable because they do not do their maintenance properly. I always prefer AMS which is much better organized!
